MethDef,"Because we have altered our hypothesis after analyzing the scatterplot, we now postulate that income tends to decrease as age decreases, we will use a one sided regression test for slope with an alternative of less than as follows."
Int,"(3) Based on our cross-validation results from the previous section, we cannot determine whether the effect of pollution appears to be instantaneous or extends over time because the difference in the average prediction errors of the two models (one with lagged variables and one with non-lagged variables) was not larger than the uncertainty of either of the prediction errors."
Data,"The mean of 'Metabolic.by.mass' is 0.0044, and its standard deviation is 0.0045, which aligns with the histogram above, but shows the strength of the rightward skew."
Lim,The variance of the residuals seems to be larger when Metabolic.log is greater.

Res,"For example, September has a DMC value that is an outlier of roughly 291.3, which is 17.5 units higher than the max DMC value for August."
Data,"Although the AnAge database contains information on over 4,200 species, our collected dataset specifically contains 347 animals in the Chordata phylum."
Res,"The estimated 95% confidence interval was found to be [-30.819, -22.345], which does not include 0."
Struct,(3) Figure 10 depicts the time series data for pollutants and temperature in Chicago from 1987 to 2000
Data,"For the purpose of this project, we will be viewing gender and sex in a binary sense, with solely male and female categories."
Struct,"Below in Figure 3, we see a scatterplot of the two variables."
Lim,We could improve this by further organizing the data into larger bins so that they are less sparsed out.
Data,"First variable is 'Maximum.longevity.yrs', which is our response variable."
MethJust,"The predictor variable is clearly significant at a high level, and the F-test for the overall model also showed clearly significant results over simply guessing the average."
RQDef,We hypothesize that there is a relationship between the number of words in titles of different categories.
Res,"However, the correlation for these variables varies between video topic category."
Int,"In the context of our current study, this means that there is sufficient evidence to show a relationship between title length in different channels, allowing us to conclude that there is sufficient evidence to show that different channels cause different title lengths."
Context,"Overall, our analysis can help both players and coaches understand what factors during a game result in the success of the team and how they can improve in the future."
MethDef,"Note, many observations had columns with missing data, so these observations were removed when analyzing the data."
Context,One of the major hot-button issues nowadays is the idea of pollution.
Data,"We then look more closely at the distribution of the temperature variable, which is left skewed and unimodal, with a spread from 278.5 Kelvin to 314.1 Kelvin and a center around 309 Kelvin."
Int,"This is not a surprise given that our predictors (lagged pollutant and temperature data) only encompass a fraction of the many variables that are related with non-accidental deaths (i.e., underlying health conditions, crime levels)"
MethJust,"In Figure 7, the residuals are mostly centered around zero, having distribution above and below the zero line as well."
Struct,"Above is our pairs plot, or scatterplots of our newly log-transformed death variable versus our key predictor variables (4)"
MethJust,"To make causal inferences, we want to reduce the omitted variable bias by as much as possible."
Int,"Clearly the countries size is not a factor, nor is developmental factors."
Res,"If we take 50% of the average metabolic by mass, we get 0.0011155 W/g."
Lim,"(2) As was seen in figures 10 and 11 above, there are a few violations of the linearity assumption, particularly that the residuals appear to not have a constant variance of have the error normally distributed."
Data,"It is defined as the maximum longevity (lifespan) of the animal subjects, measured in years (3)."
RQDef,"What are the ages of the most avid drug users, or those who abstain from drugs?"
Lim,Another limitation is that the data is only obtained from the Chicago area which could be affected by various factors such as socio-economic status and weather.
Data,"The weekly averaged variables are short hand called ""lag-variables"", indicating the measurements represent lagged time effects over the span of a week"
MethDef,The following hypothesis is tested.
MethJust,"(5) The difference between the models in terms of the uncertainty estimates do not appear to be significant because the uncertainty in standard errors for the smoothing splines differ by about 1% for every change of 1 degree of freedom, with the linear regression standard error not too far off from the smoothing spline with degree of freedom 3."
Int,"Overall, we can see that most youtube channels in this study are from the United States, followed by India and Great Britain, therefore we can somewhat assume that you would have a slightly higher probability of becoming more successful on youtube if you originate/start your account in one of these countries."
Lim,"If we were to conduct this analysis again, we would increase the sample size of youtube channels."
Data,"As shown in Figure 1, the distribution is unimodal and heavily skewed to the right."
RQDef,(2) Is the effect of air pollution instantaneous or does it extend over time.
MethDef,"To get a basic visual representation of the data, we created a box plot comparing the distribution of height across the 4 groups of status (shown in Figure 6)."
RQDef,"Based on the common knowledge that forest fires are related to hot and dry weather, we hypothesize that most of the forest fires occurred during summer, which is defined as the third quarter of the year and spans from June to August."
MethJust,"We can see that the residuals have an even spread across x = 0, and the QQ plot indicates that our residuals are very close to what they should be."
MethDef,"(4) For my chosen model (Model 2), I then draw the smoother term for each of predictor, with uncertainty."
Data,"Therefore, we also need to consider 'Temperature', typical body temperature in Kelvin, as a key variable to check if it is a confounder that affects the validity of our model."
RQDef,"If the level of each pollutant were somehow lowered to match the lowest value ever recorded, what mean death rate would we estimate for Chicago on a 70-degree day."
Struct,"To better understand the variable of playtime and form our hypothesis test, we will analyze the distribution of playtime in the 2010 World Cup."
MethJust,"Furthermore, several of our predictor variables like 'Metabolic.by.mass.log' and 'Body.mass.g.log' also appear much more normal as a result of the transformations."
RQDef,Our primary goal is to better understand the demographic of people who seek out online dating platforms.
Res,"From the boxplot above (figure x) we can see that the max, median and third quartile vary across the continents."
Data,Our final variable income is quantitative and describes the yearly income of a user.
RQDef,"Based on intuition, we would hypothesize that the greater the account age, the greater the number of subscribers, since the longer a Youtube account is active, gradually more popularity can be accumulated."
Res,"The test statistic is t=11.5972, and the p-value is reported as p=0."
MethJust,"First, it has the lowest cross validation error among all models."
Data,"We will be using the AnAge Database of Animal Aging and Longevity, which is a database of aging and life history in animals that was mainly developed for comparative biological studies."
Lim,"Considering additional variables would have helped the study as well, such as economical stability as well as cultural preferences for media content."
Context,"People have always wanted to attain immortality, and many researches have been conducted to find relationship between ages and different factors."
Data,"The entire dataset includes 16 variables: age, body type, diet, drinking habits, drug use, education, ethnicity, height, income, job, offspring, orientation, pets, sex, smoking habits, and relationship status."
RQDef,Our following research question is to examine the arrangement of categories within various countries.
Data,"For reference, the concentration of pollutants we will use for this prediction are as follows: -24.12 mg/cubic m for $PM_{10}$, -18.92 parts/billion average for $O_3$ and -4.64 parts/billion for $SO_2$"
Data,"Given in-depth information and data of ageing and life history in animals from hundreds of scientific papers for over 4,200 species, we will answer the following three questions."
Other,This is a crucial statement when understanding how pollutants affect expected deaths.
MethJust,We can see that there appears to be no definite relationship - an indication that we should employ some type of transformation to the covariates.
MethJust,"Again, we are looking at the relationship between a categorical explanatory variable and a categorical response variable."
Struct,We further explore this by creating a scatterplot of these two pollutants versus temperature in Figure 6
Res,"However, it has a relatively small median value of 1.968M in comparison to music, with a median value of 2.085M, as well as Comedy, with the greatest median value of 2.935M."
RQDef,What is the size of the effect that metabolic rate has on the lifespan of animals like crab-eating raccoons?
Res,The bootstrapped confidence interval is slightly wider than the non-bootstrapped confidence interval.
MethDef,"In this study, we investigated two different generalized additive models using a Poisson with a log link."
Int,This suggests that we should reject the null hypothesis that the lagged poisson GAM fits the data well.
Data,"For this dataset, the lowest median level of particulate matter was -24.12 milligrams per cubic meter, concentration of ozone was -18.924 parts per billion, and concentration of sulfur dioxide was -4.643 parts per billion."
Context,The billionaire Preston Jorgesen is interested in determining the factors that appear to be related to lifespan in order to use them to attain immortality.
Res,"These variables show clear relationships that are not close to being of slope zero, and have generally consistent and narrow error bounds that bolster our confidence in these relationships."
Struct,"Before conducting a formal test for the hypotheses, we visually compare the distribution of total passes for the four player positions."
Int,"This p-value implies that our model does not fit very well to the data, and we would reject our model for a saturated model instead."
Data,From an unshown boxplot we can see there are some potential outliers at values greater than .015.
MethDef,"From now on, we will be using $text{Age.log} = log(text{Max.lifespan})$ as the response variable and $text{Metabolic.log} = log(text{Metabolic.by.mass})$ as the major response variables."
Data,"The primary focus of this project will be on Sex, a categorical variable that represents the sex of each OkCupid user."
Data,The distribution is unimodal and symmetric.
Lim,"With a different choice of folds, the result could be different."
Struct,"As we are beginning our data analysis, it is important to analyze the dataset and variables contained within before creating any type of model."
MethJust,"(4) & (5) Without any transformation, the relationship between metabolic by mass and lifespan is not linear according to Figure 3."
Int,"Moreover, we found that there is a strong relationship between position and total passes, due to varying means of total passes based on the position being played."
RQDef,We wish to determine the average area a wildfire will cover and the distribution of wildfire severity (in terms of ha burned) for the purpose of deciding if human intervention may be required.
Data,"As seen in figure 5, the majority of diagnoses are from hepatitis C at 50.6% of samples, and the least common diagnosis is biliary complications at 4.7% of samples."
MethJust,"It appears that in the residuals plots, the residuals are centered around 0, so there does not seem to a violation of the linearity assumption."
Data,"All of the channels are categorized by topic, with topics such as Entertainment, Music, Gaming, Lifestyle, etc."
RQDef,"Our research questions are such: views per video dependent on the category of the account, views per video dependent on subscriber count, views per video dependent on country of origin."
Context,"With all the attention on star players, many of the players on the teams go unnoticed, even though they’re playing a lot of minutes in many games during the World Cup."
Lim,The findings from our analysis indicate that future research should be conducted along this avenue.
Data,"In this study with 517 forest fires, the mean DC was 547.94 and the standard deviation is 248.066."
Int,"By googling, we found these dates are during the 1995 Chicago Heat Wave."
Res,"In running the ANOVA test, we receive a test statistic of F=22.5416 and a p-value of 0."
Int,"If we dive into it further, these two variables have a correlation coefficient of .47, signaling a moderately strong, positive correlation."
Lim,"If we want to further explore the possibility of a lurking variable, we would need more data from other forest fires."
Res,As 'Maximum.longevity.yrs' decreases by 0.3999% when 'Metabolic.by.mass' increases by 1 %.
Context,It has been speculated from doctors and epidomiologists that air pollution is a major contributor to mortality in which people who live in areas with higher air pollution tend to have higher death rates.
Int,"We concluded that a relationship exists between smoking and body type, drinking and body type, as well as doing drugs and body type."
MethJust,Keeping this event in our data would have potentially positvely biased our regression such that predictions for the mean number of deaths would be overestimated.
MethDef,Ha: There is an association between sex and drinking habits (sex and drinking habits are dependent).
Res,"Parametric bootstrapping produced 95% confidence interval of [106.0964,124.3239] which is very similar to one we got before(6)"
MethDef,"By our reasoning in the previous section, We decide to log-transform both the response varibale 'Maximum.longevity.yrs' ('log.maximum.longevity.yrs') and the feature variable 'Metabolic.by.mass' ('log.metabolic.by.mass') as well square-root-transform to fit the model."
Res,"In other words, as logged Metabolic Rate by Mass increases, the value of logged Maximum Longevity decreases."
Data,"Similarly, so2median is the median concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO2)"
Context,Forest fires comprise a major concern for worldwide nations.
Res,"Using the best model we identified previously (smoothing spline with 6 df), we predicted that the mean lifespan of this raccoon with half the normal metabolic rate would be around 20.78 years (2)."
RQJust,"Overall, this brief analysis indicates that these relationships between covariates and our response may not necessarily be linear and the correlation between temperature and pollutants can potentially create bias in our analysis."
Int,"Because the p-value is so small, we cannot accept the null hypothesis so we will assume that the lag temperature model is correct."
MethDef,H0: There exists no relationship between drugs and body type (p > .05).
Struct,"Furthermore, we created plots (Figure 5,6,7) for our model to show the average relationship between each predictor variable and the outcome."
MethJust,"As the $Chicago$ data contains measures of temperature $tmpd$, we will preserve these outliers as they will likely be explained by our predictor variables (3)"
RQJust,We can see that each respective correlation coefficient has gotten stronger for the lag version of the variables.
Data,"However, there seems to be very weak negative relationship between temperature and log of death."
Lim,"Another limitation is that the raw data includes unknown variables that is not taken in account in some of the tests, which an alter our results."
Lim,Future studies need to be conducted regarding the risk factors for forest fires.
Data,"It ranges from 2.5 to 122.5 years, with a median of 12.9 years and mean of 16.01 years."
RQDef,This then means that the Entertainment category will have the most number of subscribers because it was the most frequent category.
RQDef,"The first being whether slowing the metabolic rate —for example, by intermittent fasting— leads to longer lifespan."
MethJust,"(5) Because of the discovered right-skewness on several variables of interest detailed in the previous section and in Figure 2, a log-transformation was performed across all the variables in attempt to make more of the variables more normal and relationships among them more linear."
Res,"When checking back to the original maximum lifespan data, we find that we have a mean value that is higher than the recorded maximum longevity of 19 years."
Data,These two new variables measure how extreme the temperature is on a specific day and over the past few days.
MethJust,This indicates that our chosen model fits the data rather well.
MethDef,"By performing a deviance test on model B, we compared it to the saturated model where each observation has a separate parameter (a perfect fit model)"
Lim,"These problems indicate that our model assumptions may be violated, which in turn means that our conclusions may be affected."
Data,"From figure 3, we see that the $death.log$ appears to be negatively associated with $lag_pm10$, $lag_ozone$, $lag_tmpd$, and $date$ (5)"
MethJust,"However, the transformation improved the distribution significantly."
Data,"Specifically, this source contains an entire database of the life history and aging of animals, providing for each species variables such as lifespan, age of sexual maturity, adult body mass, typical body temperature, and metabolic rate."
Data,"As metabolic by mass increases, lifespan decreases."
Res,Our hypothesis test compared the deviance between the between the nested and full model and output that there was a drop in deviance of 97.405 with 12 degrees of freedom and this corresponded with a p-value of 1.792e-15
MethDef,We also calculated the predicted value and its 95% confidence interval with the minimal observed values in the data before NA observations were removed.
MethJust,"Finally, the population standard deviations must be approximately equal."
Data,"It is noticeable that $death.log$ are positively associated with $lag_so2$, which is counter-intuitive."
Struct,"Before we build our models, we must explore the shape and distribution of each variable indivdually."
Int,We find that the model with temperature and the pollutants is better than the model without pollutants at a statistical significance level of alpha = 0.05 because the p-value of the chi-squared ANOVA test is less than 0.05
Res,"Those countries with the lowest viewsPerVideo are Bangladesh and Pakistan, which both have lower standard deviations indicating that their viewsPerVideo are more consistent."
Lim,"(2) However, my analysis has some limitations: first, the compared spline models are not necessarily reflecting the causal relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan, since the already known confounder 'Temperature' is not included in the model."
Res,"(3) After an extensive study on various models and metrics, we have discovered that animals with lower metabolic rates do in fact have a longer lifespan on average, and that the relationship between metabolic rate and average lifespan is not linear."
Int,"(1) This means that in general, as a species metabolic rate decreases (normalized to their body mass), their life span should increase in a linear fashion."
Lim,We could further examine why there’s a difference in amount of correlation between categories in a future study.
Struct,"We call this model Model 1.2, and table 2 present a summary of it."
Data,The histogram for time is not displayed since we know the distribution is uniform with a frequency of 1 for every date which results in a flat histogram.
Struct,We must now examine the residual diagnostics to see whether the model assumptions hold for the smooth spline.
Int,"It is also important to note that a player’s position does not correlate to these variable statistics, but is only associated with them."
MethJust,There seem to be only a couple significant outliers.
MethDef,"To determine whether pollutants are associated with mortality, we performed a hypothesis test using the chi-squared ANOVA test between a model with a generalized additive model with no pollutants and another GAM with all three pollutants: Null Hypothesis: Pollution is not associated with mortality Alternate Hypothesis: Pollution is associated with mortality."
Res,"According to Figure 5, the curves for lagged PM$_{10}$ and lagged SO$_2$ are rather flat compared to the curve of ozone."
Res,"Upon testing this hypothesis, there was a p-value of nearly 0."
MethDef,We also calculate the correlation between the variables.
Data,"Our research questions stated in the next section also include the variables, position and play time."
MethDef,"To formally test the question, we will perform an ANOVA (analysis of variance) with the null hypothesis that the average number of shots attempted is the same across all positions."
Context,"Specifically, people are looking into the best paths to starting a career in this virtual space."
Int,"Thus, among the three pollutants, ozone appears to be most associated with mortality."
RQDef,"(1) We would also like to use temperature to help model this relationship, as temperature is known to increase mortality (death rate), and we would like to use our model to predict what the death rate would be at a given temperature if we were able to reduce the pollution so that we may determine how much we need to reduce the pollution to improve a death rate."
MethJust,"Most of the deaths were reported to be poor, elderly people who did not have or were unable to afford air conditioning, and did not open their windows due to living in high-crime areas."
MethDef,"Since we meet our requirements for ANOVA, we can carry out a test at level 0.05."
Res,The smallest mean is Sports.
MethJust,This indicates that we may potentially be in violation of the linearity assumption.
Int,"From this information, we can say there is a positive correlation between doing drugs and being fit."
Data,An interesting thing to point out is that the Goalkeeper position has no median.
Res,"After running this test, we find that the test statistic is t = 1.4867 and the p-value is 0.0688."
RQDef,The second question explores the association between claim costs and duration of stay.
Struct,"In order to use this test, several conditions must be met."
RQDef,"In order to understand what causes more shares and what causes fewer shares, we must first see whether or not there is a relationship between something that attracts a lot of readers: the title."
MethJust,There are noticeable 4 ourliers in both residuals plot and QQ-plot of model2
Data,We can see from the histogram that account age is a generally unimodal variable and is right skewed.
RQDef,Question 3: Is there a linear relationship between the Shots Attempted and the Play Time.
Res,Generally the relationship looks reasonably linear with the majority of 480 cases falling into the area of 0-15ha.
MethDef,"Additionally, we assess our hypotheses with a formal inference for contingency tables."
Data,"From figure 2 we can see that there is a dense cluster on the bottom left corner, which is expected since we had both variables heavily skewed to the left when we previously visualized the individual variables with histograms."
Data,"It is the maximum longevity of the species, in years."
Data,The mean age for people who answered “often” was the lowest.
MethJust,"We also include temperature (tmpd) since we found in the Explanatory Data Analysis section that temperature appears to have negative, linear relationship with death rate."
Lim,We would also like to analyze how demographics impact the subscriber counts of a particular country or category and will look to collaborate with other data analysts to conduct this investigation.
Res,"Looking at our bootstrap, we estimated that a Crab-Eating Raccoon with a halved metabolic rate could be expected to live for more than 20 years."
MethJust,"Although this data set came from a volunteered sample, we will assume that it is reasonably random for the sake of our research."
Lim,Including more data in various geographical locations would lead to a more robust model (3)
RQDef,Our second question will be to understand the videos per video based on the number of subscribers of the channel.
Lim,Having observational data from the past decade instead can add more validity to our models and the conclusions we derive.
Data,"Surprisingly, the trend of temperature was very similar to the trend in PM10 and O3"
Context,He has tasked us with examaning pollutants that are most strongly associated with increased deaths in the hopes of reducing this pollutant or set of pollutants to further his lifespan.
Lim,One potential problem with the models relates to the two cluster of points we noted in our EDA between 'Metabolic.by.mass.log' and 'Maximum.longevity.yrs.log'.
MethJust,"Since we are interested in the relationship between extreme temperature and mortality, both extremely high and low temperatures should be considered."
Lim,"Future analysis should also include how drastic events in society may influence the amount or type of content uploaded, age demographics of these channels, screen time of the subscribers, and especially asking Social Blade the salary and wages of these channels."
MethJust,This raises the idea that perhaps transformations should be used.
Res,"(7) With this, we observe that our two confidence intervals for the expected number of deaths in Chicago, one predicted with the lowest observed pollution values and the other predicted generally, do not overlap and are entirely separate."
Res,"Upon running the tests, we get a test statistic of F = 6.12."
Int,"Although factors such as the channel category and number of subscribers can have viewsPerVideo to vary, it is hard to come to the conclusion that these are the driving forces of viewsPerVideo for these various YouTube channels."
Struct,Figure 3 below displays a boxplot of total passes for each position.
Int,"Thus, the effect of pollution appears to extend over time because model 2 has smaller cross validation error than model 1"
MethDef,"Thus, we will opt to use Model 2 since the prediction error is lower."
Int,We do not have evidence to conclude that there is a strong correlation between the two.
Int,This shows that more subscribers does not necessarily lead to more views.
Data,"The user can choose from twelve options, the lowest being 20,000 dollars and the highest being 1,000,000 dollars."
MethJust,Note that neither model includes an intercept term because its interpretation in the context of this research would be an extrapolation since metabolic rate would have to equal 1 (log(1) = 0) which would mean that an animal’s energy consumption is exactly equivalent to its body mass.
Int,'lag_tmpd.diff' appears to be most associated with mortality because its band of uncertainty is the tightest one.
Int,"We know through this test that the association between pollutants and mortality is significant to some level, as we know that air pollutant variables do have an effect on mortality (2)"
MethJust,"Moreover, the sample size (n = 595) is relatively large and greater than 30, indicating that the distribution is robust against minor violations."
RQDef,The increasing use of dating apps begs the question of how habits like drug use and well-being correlate with one another.
RQDef,"Preston Jorgensen is specifically interested in: 1) Knowing if slowing the metabolic rate can increase lifespan, 2) Finding out what kind of relationship there is between metabolic rate and lifespan, and 3) Figuring out what the effect of reducing the metabolic rate of the crab-eating raccoon by 50% would be on the animal's lifespan (1)."
Res,"With the distribution of claim costs right-skewed, the data set concludes that the majority of the cost of claims was not that high, with a median of $507.20."
Res,"Starting with the frequency bar graph of categories (figure 1, below), we observe that the most frequent category is Entertainment."
MethDef,"Therefore, it makes more sense to use a 1-dimension predictor due to curse of dimensionality, in this case 'log.metabolic.by.mass'."
Data,"Four more additional varaibles indicated by 'lag' in front of temperature, sulfure dioxide concentration median, O3 concentration median, and PM10 median which takes average values 7 days of these variables prior up to date(2)"
MethDef,We will test the following hypothesis in the slope’s significance test.
Data,The sample we will be using has a sample size of 1500 and 17 variable categories.
RQDef,"Second, is the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan nonlinear."
Int,"Therefore, we can safely say that music videos are significantly more likely to do better than Entertainment in terms of garnering views."
Res,We also noticed the number of views on a channel increase with the number of subscribers.
Int,"Since the p-value falls below our threshold of 0.01, we reject the null hypothesis that all means are equal, and conclude that there is sufficient evidence for a relationship between age and drug usage."
Res,"When we examine the relationship between account age and subscribers with different linear fits for each category displayed on the graph, we can see that all of the categories have a similar positive linear fit, just with difference in the scale of correlation."
RQDef,"Since a greater playing time indicates that a player is on the field for a longer duration of time, it can be reasonable to assume that more time on the field can lead to more passes being made."
RQDef,Our first hypothesis deals with the relationship between sex and income.
MethDef,"Specifically, model 3 is: begin{center}E[log(Death)] = $beta_0$ + s(Lag Temperature)end{center}"
Context,"Even just within the past year, we saw the California wildfires turn nearly the entire west coast upside down (as reported by Mercury News, February 28, 2021 https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/28/editorial-california-must-pass-emergency-wildfire-prevention-funding/)."
Data,'tmpd' is originally the mean temperature (Fahrenheit)
Res,"We found that with a 50% smaller metabolic rate, an animal with the crab-eating raccoon’s characteristics has a mean lifespan of 20.78 years (2)."
Lim,"Presently we can not do so because we only have mortality, pollution, and temperature data for Chicago."
Data,"From the scatter plot in figure 2, we see that there seems to be a negative relationship between $Max.lifespan$ and $Metabolic.by.mass$ (6)."
RQDef,"Our goal here is to explore the relationship between subscriber count and account category, country, and age."
RQDef,We hypothesize that the United States will have the largest median subscriber count since Youtube is an American-based company.
MethJust,"However, the study could easily combine categories in order to account for this."
RQDef,The research goal is to explore the relationship between mortality and the predictors.
Res,We found that World Cup players tend to have an average playing time of about 200 minutes.
Int,"Because our p-value is less than the significance level of alpha=0.05, then we have sufficient evidence to reject the null, that the true mean age is 30 years old, and that we have evidence for the alternative hypothesis, that the true mean age for the user is greater than 30 years old."
Data,The data we have contains 517 forest fires from the Montesinho Natural Park in Portugal from January 2000 to December 2003.
Res,"After taking into account the key characteristic variables (Metabolic.rate, Body.mass.g, and Metabolic.by.mass), applying the proper log transformations, and using our model, we estimate the mean lifespan of an animal with these characteristics to be 20.12 years (2)."
Int,"Second, the effect of pollution on death extends over time."
MethDef,In both models we used spline smoother terms for all of the predictors with 4 degrees of freedom for all of the spline terms.
MethJust,"Furthermore, the data was gathered using randomization and the standard deviations are relatively within a factor of 2."
Int,This seems to indicate that metabolisms that fall within that range do not all have around the same lifespan and the negative relationship observed for other values is weaker or even nonexistent here.
MethJust,We thought it would be inappropriate to combine it with any other group as being married is usually not indicative that they are open to be engaging in another relationship.
Data,"For context, the median salary of all OkCupid users is $50,000."
MethDef,We use 5-fold cross validation.
RQDef,"In our research, we utilized a Poisson generalized additive model with the lagged (7-day average) variables of 'temperature', $PM_{10}$, $O_3$, and $SO_3$ to explore the association between atmospheric pollutants and mortality (count of non-accidental deaths)"
Res,"In fact, 48.06% (246/517) of the recorded fires have an area value of 0.1 hectares or below."
Data,"The minimum number of videos uploaded is 1, and the maximum is 130 thousand."
RQJust,This suggest that temperature and ozone levels may be related such that increasing temperatures result in increasing ozone levels.
Data,The mean income for people who answered “often” was the highest.
Other,We also have to make sure the standard deviations of each group are relatively similar to use the ANOVA test.
MethJust,(4) The difference in the models does appear significant as there is very large differences in prediction error between splines at lower versus higher degrees of freedom.
RQDef,"First, we will find evidence, if any, that if slowing the metabolic rate would increase the life span."
Int,"At lower levels of metabolic rate, the trend is not as clear, for the most part lifespan is higher yet but the range of lifespans is higher than at higher levels of metabolic rate."
Data,"We notice that $death.log$ generally follows the normal distribution, and its mean and median are both 4.736 (2)"
Int,There is no sufficient evidence to conclude that there is an association between relationship status and height of users.
Lim,"From our disucssion above, we have already known that 'Temperature' is a confounder, so we need to add it to our model for controlling."
Data,o3median - The median concentration of ozone (parts per billion)
Int,"A possible explanation might be that extremely low levels of ozone at ground level are a signal of insufficient amount of ozone in the stratosphere, which could lead to excessive ultraviolet (which is detrimental to health) at ground level."
Res,"Since Model 2, the one with the lagged versions of the 7 day averages of the pollutants as the covariates, performed better with a lower cross-validation error, it appears that the effect of pollution extends over time."
Int,(2) I can not conclude that reducing the crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% would cause its lifespan to change.
Context,A prime example of this is dating sites.
MethJust,"All standard deviations are within a factor of 2, meaning they are so sufficiently close to use our ANOVA test."
Context,"Here, we aim to determine whether you should smoke or not if you want to aim to be fit."
MethJust,"Given that we identified slight heteroskedasticity and poisson GAM is non-linear, we can not conduct a fully parametric or resampling of residuals bootstrap method."
RQJust,Certain positions like the goalkeeper may not be making more passes just due to more time.
RQDef,Our third question will be to analyze if there is any association or correlation between a soccer player’s position and the total passes they make within a professional season.
Context,A creator with little to no views can garner thousands after posting just one video that makes its way to the main page.
Res,The most popular category was Entertainment and the least popular was Sports.
Data,This dataset also includes lagged versions of the pollution and temperature variables which are simply 7 day averages of each respective variable.
MethDef,"We also then fit five spline models, with the effective degrees of freedom for each spline model being 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7."
Res,The United States’s views per video’s median is around 1.411 million.
MethDef,For these reasons we have decided not to explore any of these variables any furthur.
Struct,We first look at how our response changes over time.
Int,"That is, one can expect the mean lifespan of an animal with the same characteristics as a crab-eating raccoon but with a 50% smaller metabolic rate to be between 18.20 and 22.21 years (3)."
MethDef,We then take the exponential of that estimate as our prediction of the maximum lifespan for that round of bootstrap.
Context,"This event marked five days in 1995, from July 12 to July 16, of record high temperatures and overwhelming humidity which resulted in 739 heat-related deaths."
Int,One interesting finding is that there is a correlation between age of account and views per video for only videos in the Education category - perhaps the Education based channels have a loyal following.
MethJust,(2) We therefore can say that model 2 is the better model based on the cross validation error.
Data,Clear outliers we can in both plots are an unusually large amount of deaths in the summer of 1995
MethDef,"In order to see the validity of our interval, we utilize parametric bootstrapping to generate new data and construct a new confidence interval."
Int,"To summerize our models, the decrease in metabolic rate leads to increase in lifespan."
Struct,"(3) Additionally, I have used a pairs plot to show the correlation between the continuous variables in the dataset, and check if there exists any multicollinearity in between variables."
Data,"We also know that the data spans every day for 13 years, which may impact these patterns with the passage of new laws, restrictions, or change in crime rates that can impact our desired response."
Res,This can be noticed in the fact that the density toward the origin is far denser than as it moves away.
Struct,Figure 7 is a plot showing our two models (lagged GAM in blue and non-lagged GAM in red) overlayed on a scatterplot of our response variable 'death' over time.
MethDef,"Preamble: We define lower income as being under the median income of the sample, which we define below."
Int,"Therefore, by the data observed from Figure 5, we can confirm our hypothesis that the greatest amount of YouTube channels appears within the entertainment category."
Context,"We would ask Preston Jorgensen to revert to the recommendations in our introduction that he should give us a different, more thorough dataset, refer to an expert in this field, or look at a different method to extend his lifespan."
Int,"Therefore, it’s lower average of views per video make sense (Median views per video for Italy is around 310,000."
Data,The boxplots clearly shows outliers comprised of days with large concentrations of the respective air pollutants.
Data,"Our primary focus in this report will be on the variable of Playtime, a quantitative variable measuring the time on the field each player spent during the world Cup (in minutes)."
RQJust,This allows us to assume that knowing one variable helps in predicting the other.
Int,It is possible to assume that a certain channel is continuously uploading content of a popular artist that may be consistently releasing music videos with high view counts.
Context,"When I consider such an impact, it is usually negative as well."
Data,"The subscriber count ranges from 107,329 to 27,765,423 subscribers."
Int,"Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no association between sex and smoking habits, and conclude that there is not sufficient evidence for a relationship between sex and smoking habits."
MethDef,"From an ANOVA Chi squared test between the simple model with just temperature and Model 2, we get a deviance of 247.56 with p-value of 2.2e-16"
RQJust,The higher frequency of one category increases its’ chances of getting more subscribers.
Data,Total passes is a quantitative variable indicating how many passes each player made during the World Cup.
Data,The mean duration is 164 days and the standard deviation of duration is 120.916 days.
MethDef,MU is the true mean playtime for each of the positions.
MethJust,It is clear that the spline models have much lower MSE estimates than the linear model.
Data,"The datapoints overall are a bit spread out which gives a slight randomness, but still gives strong evidence of negative and linear relationship."
RQDef,The goal of this report is to identify if these notable differences can be indicated — or correlated — with two other variables also collected in the same data set.
Data,"DMC is the moisture content of deep and shallow organic layers, and the mean DMC out of the 517 forest fires studied was 110.872."
MethJust,"At first glance at the scatterplot has a gentle negative slope, but appears to have some curvature to it that indicates a linear model may not be the most effective choice."
MethJust,"Since thousands of people are given liver transplants each year, 77 patients is certainly much smaller."
Res,Figure 9 clearly shows that in general lower metabolic rates (which lead to lower log(metabolic.by.mass)) correspond to higher maximum life span (which leads to higher log(Maximum.longevity.yrs) (1) .
MethDef,"In this context, df includes 3,4,5,6, and 7 such that there are five smoothing spline models, one for each unique value of degrees of freedom."
Context,He wants to know whether the estimated impact of reducing pollution concentration on the average death rate is worth substantial investment in efforts to mitigate pollution levels.
Data,(3) The time series plot shows a clear seasonal pattern in the number of deaths.
RQJust,"Due to drug usage becoming more popular recently, we hypothesize that younger individuals, between the ages of 18-30, will be more likely to use drugs than older individuals."
RQDef,Alternative hypothesis: There is an association between sex and status.
MethJust,"Therefore, we choose to include these outliers rather than removing them from the analyses because they are explained by variables in the data and are meaningful."
Int,"Since the p-value falls below our threshold of 0.01, we reject the null hypothesis that all means are equal, and conclude that there is sufficient evidence for a relationship between income and drug usage."
MethJust,It would not be surprising to find that I get a different best model if I use a different setup for cross validation.
Context,"As the era of technology continues to grow, so do the different ways people can start to profit off of it."
Struct,"Given our data, we will be answering the following three questions."
Lim,This could be further examined in the future.
Context,Conclusions from this study might be of assistance in this matter.
MethJust,"First, the groups must be independent and the samples must be random, which they are."
Data,"$ozone$ seems to follow a right-skewed distribution, with a mean of -2.024 and a median of -3.164 parts per million (1)"
RQDef,We will be analyzing this data to ultimately build a statistical model to examine the relationship between the lifespan and metabolic rate of animals.
Data,What’s noticeable here is that there are a good number of people who said their income is above 1 million.
MethDef,"To first tackle this question, we identified the crab-eating raccoon’s characteristics to calculate its smaller metabolic rate, input that value into our model to determine the estimated mean log of lifespan and then perform an exponential transformation on that result to get an interpretable output in years."
RQDef,"Lastly, we will try to predict the mortality rate given lowest level of pollutants recorded to check if there is any meaningful decrease in mortaility rate(1)"
Res,"However, for the most part, we see an inverse relationship between the log metabolic rate and log lifespan in this graph (1)."
Int,"Among the three kinds of pollutants, ozone is most strongly associated with mortality."
Res,(7) We notice a difference between the two confidence intervals.
RQDef,"To address Mr.Preston Jorgensen's concerns, we will demonstrate our findings by estimating the mortality in Chicago when air pollution is at the minimal level in the historical record (1)"
Data,The variable is measured in watts/gram and metabolic.by.mass will be used instead of metabolic.rate for the remainder of the report.
Int,"Thus, it appears that $ozone$ (more specifically, $lag_ozone$) is most strongly associated with mortality (4)"
Int,"All in all, because of the big difference in the measurements of subscribers across continents, the evidence we have can back the idea that there is an association between the continent the channel originates from and the number of subscribers."
Data,"(1) The four predicor variables are PM$_{10}$ pollution, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and temperature, or their respective lagged versions."
Data,"Our sample mean is approximately 33 years, and our sample standard deviation is approximately 10 years."
Int,"Due to these three countries having the greatest amounts of channels, the content created is essential so that new creators can imitate what they are doing."
Struct,The new distribution graphs after the log transformation shown in figure 6.
MethDef,"Preamble: We define physical wellness being a body type of “athletic”, “average”, “fit”, “jacked”."
MethJust,This similarity means that our assumption about the distribution of the data being Poisson is likely to be correct.
Res,"For these animals, their lifespans appear to be equivalent and not change with their metabolic rate."
Res,"When we look at the shape of this histogram, we can see that the data is bimodal, meaning that there are two “peaks” in the data."
Context,"Due to this enormous popularity, the sport consists of numerous teams that compete for the number one title at the Fifa World Cup."
Res,"After performing this test, we get a test statistic of 4.0258 and a pValue of 0.0001."
MethJust,We can see that the points largely follow the line with a few outliers towards end boundary.
Context,"A majority of these deaths were elderly Chicago residents who could not afford air conditioning or were reluctant to open their windows in fear of crime (i.e., home invasion)"
Res,"Performing the test, we get a test statistic of F = 25.4705 and a p-value that is approximately 0."
RQDef,The purpose of this analysis is to see whether there is any claim type that received significantly higher damages compared to other types of claim.
RQDef,"Our final question at hand, is to study whether the number of subscribers of a channel and its respective viewsPerVideo count are correlated to one another."
MethJust,"Since removing observations with NAs would still leave us with a substantially large dataset (4011 observations), we will do EDA and model selection with the reduced dataset (days with complete data)"
Res,"In the $Chicago$ dataset, the lowest $lag_ozone$ is -18.924, the minimum $lag_so2$ is -4.643, and the minimum $lag_pm10$ is -24.119 (5)"
MethDef,Our null and alternative hypotheses are.
Res,"Within each continent, the entertainment category has the highest number of channels."
Struct,(1) There are three aspects that he is particularly interested in.
RQJust,"Since we have anecdotal evidence that more posts in a thread lead to a higher view count, we will test the following hypotheses."
MethJust,"The residuals are more negative for larger metabolic by mass values, which makes resampling residuals inappropriate."
Res,"Upon observation of plot 5, we can clearly see that, as account age increases, the density of data points decreases, meaning that there are more young accounts than old accounts."
RQDef,"In order to understand the success of Mashable, we will be exploring the relationship between all the possible different channels offers, the title length of each article, and the number of shares distributed."
MethJust,"Model summary (not shown) suggests that in model1, all variables are significant except SO2"
Res,"(1) In summary, we find that the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan is not linear, but there does seem to be a negative relationship between the two variables."
MethDef,"While we cannot definitively assume that the death variables by season are normally distributed, the log-transformation allows us to roughly assume normality and find a general 99.7% confidence bound based from winter deaths and summer deaths, shown as the orange and blue lines above."
RQJust,We expect to see negative relationship between 'Metabolic.by.mass' and 'Maximum.longevity.yrs' variables in the analysis since we see a negative trend between explanatory variables in the pairs plot in figure 5.
MethJust,"Looking at the qqplot, we can see that the points closely follow the diagonal with only minor deviations at the tails."
Data,"The six variables measure the number of days before/after Dec 31, 1993, number of non-accidental deaths, median density of small particulate matter (air pollution), median concentration of ozone, median concentration of sulfur dioxide, and the mean temperature in Fahrenheit."
MethDef,"More specifically, we will use 10-fold cross-validation to estimate the MSE"
Res,"The lagged GAM had a deviance of 5208.5, while the non-lagged GAM had a deviance of 5604.2"
MethJust,"Since the distribution of deaths differs based on season, defining our response's confidence bounds by season is a cautious and conservative approach to diagnosing outliers."
Struct,(2) Below are plots showing the univariate distribution 'Metabolic.by.mass' and 'Temperature'.
Res,(1) The relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan is moderately linear.
Context,"Channels can even get paid five figures per year, and this number grows more than 50% year by year."
MethDef,"For simplicity, we will conduct a complete-case analysis, which means we will only retain observations that do not contain any missing values (1)"
Struct,"In order to use this test, several conditions must be met."
MethDef,"We therefore decide to leave these values in our data set as accounted for extremes, or perhaps, part of the 0.3% we did not include in our bounds."
RQJust,The sample median for age is 31.00.
MethDef,"(1) To allow comparisons between animals of different sizes, I first create a new variable which divides the metabolic rate by body mass."
Lim,The data set is not large enough to account for those confounding variables.
Lim,"Additionally, the resampling cases bootstrap may have been too broad and as such less accurate, so it may be helpful to check more in-depth whether the error of our model is uniformly distributed, so that we may do a resampling residuals and more specific bootstrap."
Int,Our tests indicated an association between sex and status but no association between status and age or height.
Struct,"From Figure 1, we see the distribution of our non-lagged covariates ($PM_{10}$, $O_3$, $SO_2$, and 'temperature')"
Int,"Given our results from model analysis, we concluded that the effect of pollution extends over time."
MethDef,"Moreover, we built some linear models with different types of transformation."
Lim,"If further research were to be conducted, it would be necessary to delve into many other factors that would show a more direct link with viewsPerVideo."
Context,"Throughout history, the quest for immortality has remained a tried and true staple of humanity."
Data,"If we look at the plot for the death variable in Figure 1, we can see that the histogram is unimodal and skewed left."
Struct,"To understand the variable, we will explore the distribution of the number of shots attempted."
RQDef,"In this study, we will be analyzing the relationship of pollution and temperature on death rate."
MethDef,We can carry out the test at level 0.05.
Data,There are total of 9 key variables to consider.
Data,The quantitative variable ISI denotes a numeric value estimating the rate of fire spread.
MethJust,"From heuristics, we know that $death$ will likely follow the Poisson distribution."
RQDef,"We hypothesize that costs would increase as age increases, on the means that as we age, we tend to suffer more health issues."
MethJust,"We note that the relationship of both transformed and non-transformed data of the two variables are not linear, which is the reason why we choose spline models."
RQDef,We investigated in EDA and modelling sections to find out whether there is a relationship between pollutants and mortality.
RQDef,"First, will slowing the metabolic rate increase the lifespan."
Int,"We notice that 21.34173 falls in the range of confidence interval, indicating the reduction in metabolic rate leads to lifespan increase."
Context,This work can be used by YouTube creators and users to improve their experience on the platform and understand the workings of it.
Res,"Finally, there is no strong relationship between number of videos uploaded and subscriber count, which is also surprising."
Int,"Since they do not overlap, we can infer that lower average pollutant measurements, for PM10 and ozone pollutants, likely result in lower deaths per day in Chicago."
Int,My main findings about the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan is that there is supported evidence to slowing the metabolic rate may increase lifespan.
Res,"Also, the standard deviation is 1837561.611 and such a large value indicates that there should be quite a few outliers in this data set."
Context,"And within recent times, the natural disaster that has shook up not just the United States, but also the world, has been forest fires."
Data,Age is a quantitative variable that measuring the age of subscribers.
RQJust,This suggests that there may be a relationship between severity and PatientMDRB.
Res,"Based on the plots in Figure 7, it appears that the ozone variables is the most associated because its graph has the largest curve and is the least linear (4)"
RQJust,"The more channels there are under one category, the better chance that that specific category will have more subscribers compared to a category that has a lesser count since there are more channels to subscribe to."
Int,"It can be determined that although it would seem like subscribers effect viewsPerVideo, the data does not support this hypothesis as the correlation between subscriber count and viewsPerVideo is very weak and can also be seen by the scatter plot that accounts with high subscribers have roughly the same viewsPerVideo as other accounts with less subscribers."
RQJust,"Also, depending on what age people retire, there may be a slight dip in the 60s-year range."
Context,"Over the past decade, Youtube has grown from a relatively unknown website into a video platform with channels gaining millions of subscribers and individual videos gaining over tens of millions of views."
MethDef,We have developed a linear regression model controlling the confounding variable typical body temperature to see the causal relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan.
RQDef,The third research question we will discover is to investigate whether the number of subscribers impacts the number of views on a channel.
MethDef,"Moving on to Modeling and Diagnostics, we want to make two Poisson models to compare and see how they do with our dataset."
Res,"The bootstrap was repeated 1000 times, however the confidence interval is still much larger than it is for the other method of estimation."
Int,"(2) After evaluating several models and variable characteristics, our research led us to the conclusion that pollutants extended over time have a relationship with mortality."
RQDef,What determines how long an animal will live?
Res,"So when the two graphs are combined to form an entire distribution from 0 to $44,968,563 (max), the primary mode should be in the range $0-$2500."
Struct,"The first number represents the MSE estimates, and the second number represents the standard error estimates."
Data,"The most popular position being Midfielder with 38.3% (228 of the total 595), then Defender with 31.6% (188 of the total 595), followed by Forward with 24% (143 of the total 595), and finally Goalkeeper with 6.1% (36 of the total 595)."
Data,"The data includes a unique identifying number for each entry (a HAGRID), information on the species' kingdom, common name, maximum lifespan (years), body mass (in grams), temperature (in Kelvin), and finally metabolic rate (in Watts), which is the typical resting metabolic rate (rate of energy used) of the species."
Data,"There are a few outliers at 19, 21, 22, and 27 shots."
Data,"Temperature's positive relationship with ozone is more clear, but it also seems to have a positive association with PM10, which was ambiguous previously."
MethDef,"For this study, we used a generalized additive model on the lagged covariates to determine the association between atmospheric pollutants and death rate."
Int,"Also, as we have argued, extremely low levels of pollutants (like ozone) might be associated with an increase in mortality."
MethJust,"Since we have a categorical explanatory variable (sex) and categorical response variable (status), we can conduct a chi-square test."
RQJust,"If a thread is recently posted, it has a much smaller timeframe to receive a higher count of views or activity to promote it."
MethDef,"In this case, we have two means, so we use the two-sample mean test."
Int,"This confirms how only a few amount of channels are successfully able to maintain a high engagement, or a large view per video count."
Int,"With this conclusion, we also see that the best position for a player in order to have the most shots attempted is Forward, followed by Midfielder, then Defender, and then Goalkeeper."
Lim,"During our selection process for determining the best model, we only considered a linear model that took into account the metabolic rate as a predictor for Lifespan."
Int,They can also understand the correlation between the number of subcribers and views per video is very low.
Struct,"To better understand the playing time of players, we will perform exploratory analysis by examining the distribution of playing time in the 2010 World Cup."
Data,"We will be using information collected from a 2012 study that collected data from the San Francisco are, from 1,500 users."
Struct,"Additionally, 3 more conditions must be met to justify the Chi-Square Test."
Lim,"Furthermore, it may be interesting for other studies that may base this work to look at the relationship between certain variable statistics and other sports."
Lim,It would be better if the components for the ‘other’ category can be specified because it may help to generate a better understanding for the relationship between ClaimType and TotalDamages.
Data,"As shown in the frequency table above, the majority of channels are based in the Americas, which has a grand total of 634."
RQJust,A player that is not confident in their abilities will not try and score goals because they will most likely miss.
Lim,"(2) However, it is worth noting that this setting is problematic."
Struct,Figure 3 shows a pairs plot of different predictor variables and the response variable.
RQDef,We hypothesize that there may be different amounts of playing time dependent on position due to player availability and substitutions that can be made during the game.
Data,"The data we are given contains 5,114 observations where each observation represents a day with 6 variables: time (number of days), death (number of non-accidental deaths), pm10median (milligrams per cubic meter), o3median (parts per billion), so2median (SO2), and tmpd (Fahrenheit) (2)"
Int,"This is interesting to note because (1) it appears to contradict our initial assumption that higher temperatures and concentrations of pollutants are associated with high deaths and (2) there may exist a hidden variable that ""explains"" the strong positive correlation between temperature and pollutants"
Int,"(1) To Preston Jorgensen's interest, we can conclude with 95% confidence that reducing the crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% would cause its lifespan to change."
MethJust,"Based on the univariate EDA, both the predictor variable, metabolic by mass, and the reponse variable, lifespan, are skewed to the right."
Context,The internet made us more connected than ever before.
Struct,The following figure displays a contingency table for proportion for each group.
Lim,"There could perhaps be other air pollutant variables at play, or non-air related variables that influenced our outcome that we overlooked (3)"
MethDef,"(5) Two interesting candidate transformations of the data are applying the log function to both variables, and applying the log function to mass-adjusted metabolism and the reciprocal to longevity."
MethDef,"Based on these results, we determined that the spline model with 6 degrees of freedom provided the best fit for the data since it has the smallest prediction error (0.3538)."
Lim,"(3) First of all, we do not know if there are other factors contributing to this lifespan difference."
MethDef,Ha: beta1 > 0.
MethJust,"However, since the predictor error is only seperated by approximately 1 standard error, the difference only seems slightly significiant."
Data,"(1) In figures 2, 3, and 4, we can see that the median concentrations of ozone and sulfur dioxide, and the median density of $PM_{10}$ pollution all appear to be skewed slightly to the right."
MethDef,"Thus, the models will use four explanatory variables: pm10median, o3median, so2median, and tmpd."
RQDef,Our first analysis includes the effect of drinking on how fit you are.
Res,"Surprisingly, a decrease in the $SO_2$ level appears to be associated with an increase in mortality (4)"
Struct,"In order to do this, we again look at our spline curve with our plotted data points."
Data,"It contains 5,114 observations and main 6 variables with 4 additional lag variables for pollutants and temperature."
RQDef,"If so, which pollutant is the most strongly associated with mortality."
MethDef,"To evaluate how well each model fit the data, we used 5-fold cross-validation and mean squared error (MSE)."
Data,Our research will contain other variables including the number of subscribers and the channel category.
MethDef,The first model will use the non-lagged covariates to determine the possibility of non-accidental deaths being related to air quality and temperature over a single day.
RQDef,"In conclusion, understanding the factors that influence an animals lifespan continues to be an important and fundamental question in science."
Int,"With that in mind, we can safely affirm that Music and Entertainment videos are the best categories for someone to create content in if hoping to gain high views."
Context,"A.H Mokdad, J.S Marks, and J.L Gerberding created a study called Actual causes of death in the United States finding an estimated 95,000 people die from alcohol-related causes annually [2]."
Int,From this we conclude that there is sufficient evidence of a positive linear relationship between the number of attempted shots and the play time of the players.
Res,"When we answered question 2, we saw that channels with subscribers ranging from 0 to 5 million subscribers tend to gain views per video around the number of subscribers they have."
Res,"When answering question 1, we saw that videos in the Music categories tend to the best in terms of gaining views, with Entertainment videos coming in at a close second."
Int,"Preston Jorgensen cannot conclude that reducing the pollutants would cause mortality to decrease to the amount our model estimated because this is observational data so we are only able to estimate correlation, which we do not even believe we have in this case (2)"
Struct,We will compare the 6 models we create and then once we have calcuated which model is most efficient we will utilze that model to answer the questions of billionaire Preston Jorgensen.
Struct,"The plots on the diagonal show the marginal distribution curves of the key variables, which is similar to the histograms in figure 1."
Lim,"Since children have more free time in the day, therefore, having more time to watch more videos, it is plausible that channels with minors as their predominant viewing audience would have more views."
Int,But I can only conclude association instead of causation because the predictor is not randomly assigned and there might be unmeasured counfounding variable outside the dataset.
MethJust,"Now the general trend looks linear, but a linear model may not best describe the relationship between the two."
MethDef,"Despite Model 2 does not fit significantly better than Model 1, we still choose Model 2 as our final model (3)"
Data,"Finally, the distribution of the untransformed response variable, maximum longevity or lifespan, can be seen in figure 4, where we notice that the variable lifespan has a distribution which is skewed slightly to the right."
Res,"For a typical crab-eating raccoon, Model 5 predicts that its maximum lifespan is expected to be 14.51303 years."
Int,This is expected as non-parametric bootstrap relies on fewer assumptions and captures more variance in the data.
Int,"In addition, it is important to note that the results in our tests only indicate an association between age, height, or sex and status."
RQDef,Null hypothesis: There is no association between sex and status.
MethJust,"(4) We see a moderate negative linear relationship between 'Metabolic.by.mass.log' and 'Maximum.longevity.yrs.log', having an $R^2$ value of -0.585, which originally did not look linear and looked more like a power law relationship."
Int,"We must also acknowledge that our expected deaths predicted with our lowest observed pollution values takes place during a time when the temperature is 70 degrees, or likely during the summer months."
Data,"From figure 1, we observe that our pollution variables, original and lagged, have longer right tails than left tails."
Struct,We will use data on crab-eating raccoons to illustrate our findings.
RQDef,Our primary goal is to better understand the demographic of people who seek out online dating platforms.
Lim,This is difficult since our pollution variables tend to vary with time as well.
Lim,Limitations of this study primarily revolve around the scope.
Data,Such that lower metabolic rates appear to be related to larger lifespans.
MethDef,"To do so, we will conduct a global goodness of fit test using a Chi square distribution with the deviance of the model and the degrees of freedom."
MethDef,"To get a basic visual representation of the data, we created a box plot comparing the distribution of age across the 4 groups of status (shown in Figure 5)."
MethJust,We use smooth splines for individual variables as we see in EDA that the relationships between the response and explanatory variables do not appear linear (1)
Res,"It can be seen in the plot above that the median viewsPerVideo in Egypt and the United States are higher, roughly in the 400,000-500,000 range."
Data,"The mean ISI is roughly 9 and the median ISI is 8.4, which is slightly lower than the mean."
Struct,"For our usage here, the histogram of age (Figure 1) will be added below."
Res,The model estimates 107.9548 non-accidental deaths for this theoretical observation.
Data,"We may claim that the data points have close to normal distribution, but skewed to the right (3)."
Data,"Each observation has 6 variables, explained below: time: The date of observation, given as the number of days before or after December 31, 1993 death: The number of non-accidental deaths on that date pm10median: The median density of PM$_{10}$pollution, i.e., particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers (milligrams per cubic meter) lag_pm10median: 7 day average of the median density of PM$_{10}$pollution, i.e., particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers (milligrams per cubic meter) o3median: The median concentration of ozone (parts per billion) lag_o3median: 7 day average of the median concentration of ozone (parts per billion) so2median: The median concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO2) lag_so2median: 7 day average of the median concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO2) tmpd: The mean temperature (Fahrenheit) lag_tmpd: 7 day average of the mean temperature (Fahrenheit) After the analysis of this data, we were not able to find a clear correlation between pollutants and mortality (3)"
Int,We found that a player’s position is associated with all three variable statistics.
RQJust,"My hypothesis for this research question is that country will indeed effect viewPerVideo, as not many people or multilingual so they most likely watch videos majority from their country as it is their language."
Struct,"First, let’s analyze the shape."
Data,"The highest number of subscribers for a channel was 27,765,423 ( TheEllenShow ) whereas the channel with the lowest number had 107,329 (FORTNITE IS MY CL)."
MethJust,"This means that the highest deaths aren't paired with disproportionately high temperatures, which was the primary contributor to the deaths in real life."
MethDef,"Note that the time variable has been converted to a date object, 'date' for visualization purposes."
MethDef,"To do so, we will conduct a global goodness-of-fit test on our lagged GAM"
Int,"The difference between the pollution's instantaneous effect and continuing effect is very small, and we may get a different answer from a different sample."
Res,"Although Figure 2 shows a mode in the $277,657-$500,000 range, its count (62, according to isle) becomes relatively insignificant compared to the mode of Figure 1 in the range $0-$2500 (766, according isle)."
RQJust,"Using the fact that we observed a large amount of physically well people “never” used drugs (66%), we form the hypotheses."
Struct,Residaul diagnosis was examined represented by the Figure7
Data,"We have two other potentially useful explanatory variables in 'Body.mass.g.', the typical adult body mass in grams, and in 'Temperature', the typical body temperature in Kelvin."
Int,This means I have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is association between pollutants and mortality.
Data,'Metabolic.rate' and 'Body.mass.g' are our explonatory variables.
RQDef,"First, are pollutants like ozone, SO$_{2}$, and PM$_{10}$ associated with increased deaths."
Lim,"In Figure 8, the residulas seem to depend on the predictor."
Data,Age is a quantitative variable that measures the user’s age in years.
Res,We can also note that the United States’s boxplots have more outliers in the higher view counts.
MethDef,"To answer our research question, we will fit generalized additive models (GAM) to predict $death$ from our explanatory variables using the log link from the Poisson family, as we assume $death$ follows the Poisson distribution."
RQDef,"Since it is likely that different positions of players cause players to have different playtimes, it seems relatively sensible to hypothesize that there will be different mean playtimes based on the position a player plays."
RQDef,"Essentially, we predict that the mean income for users who answered “often” or “sometimes” will be different from the mean income for users who answered “never”."
Context,Youtube allows people to upload anything from home videos to news to professional productions with purposes ranging from entertainment to education.
Lim,"Also, in this model, we use maximum lifespan, instead of average lifespan, as a measure of life expectancy."
MethJust,"The rest of the spline models (degrees of freedom 3,4,6,7) had an estimated MSE of prediction error between 0.35425 - 0.3561."
MethDef,Users who chose “never” are said to be non-drug users.
Struct,We note this because we might find later when we are modeling that the lagged versions of the predictors are more useful in predicting deaths because they are more stable.
Data,The dataset used in this report focuses on the Montesinho natural park and is collected from January 2000 to December 2003.
Data,The mean for DMC is 110.
MethDef,We will be using log-transformed data points in order to make our analysis easier as we showed in EDA step.
Data,"Our research questions will have us looking at the variables category, subscribers, and country."
Struct,We then look at the p-value of the test to determine if this difference is significant.
Data,"It's important to note that although the histogram visualization may suggest that there are animals with metabolic rates of zero, the lowest metabolic rate in this dataset is 0.04 watts/grams (2)."
Int,"Due to the fact that people are usually on YouTube for entertainment and educational purposes, it made sense that those respective categories resulted in a larger viewsPerVideo count."
Res,It would change from 'r raccoon$Max.longevity.years' years to between 31.56516 years and 41.40858 years with 95% confidence.
RQDef,It stands to reason that certain months have different cyclic factors which lend themselves to a greater or lesser intensity wildfire.
Data,"Our main focus is a channel’s category, a qualitative variable that is user-defined and describes the channel topic."
Res,"Given that the partial response functions for lagged PM10 and ozone show noticeable curvature and slope while that of lagged sulfur dioxide appears more flat with a small slope and less curvature, we have evidence to suggest that the lagged PM10 and ozone variables appear to be most associated with mortality among the pollutants."
Res,"Our Chi-Square Test produces a test statistic of Chi-Sq=7.3913, and a p-value of 0.1931."
MethDef,"Therefore, in our model the reponse, deaths, is given a natural log transformation since log and natural log are synonymous in this context."
Lim,"The smoothing adds complexity to the model, and terms like 'lag_tmpd' and 'lag_so2median' appear to have a linear effect on the outcome."
Data,"These cases do not belong to listed categories such as malpractice, motor vehicle, fraud, premises liability or rental/lease."
Int,"Thus, it appears that the effect of pollution extends over time but we must also be aware that this is observational data so we cannot conclude that pollution absolutely causes higher mortality rate over time (3)"
MethDef,"This line plots the average number of log-deaths over a 4 week period (one month), which allows us to more clearly see how the number of deaths changes over the years, in general."
RQDef,Our second question focuses on the size of the user base for each country on the platform.
Int,"It is not reasonable for Preston Jorgensen to conclude that reducing a crab eating raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% would cause its lifespan to change because there are a variety of factors including by not limited to geographic location, environemntal conditions, and diet that directly influence lifespan but are not within the scope of our dataset (2)."
Struct,Plots for both of these are output below.
RQJust,"Furthermore, the Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.815 is closer to 1, suggesting a more linear shape rather than a cloud-like shape."
Data,"In Figure 2, the distribution of 'log(death)' appears to be normal."
MethDef,"To model the data, we will use two Poisson generalized additive models, one using the covariates that are not lagged, and one with the lagged versions of the covariates, with the 7-day averages of each measurement."
MethDef,The two models are as follows: (1) Non-lagged GAM: Death ~ $beta_0$ + s($PM_{10}$) + s($O_3$) + s($SO_2$) + s('temperature')  Lagged GAM: Death ~ $beta_0$ + s($lagPM_{10}$) + s($lagO_3$) + s($lagSO_2$) + s('lag_temperature')
Struct,Figure 5 visualizes our model by overlaying the fitted spline (from Model 5) on top of the scatter plot between $Age.log$ and $Metabolic.log$.
MethDef,"(1) To facilitate comparison across the many variable species with widely varying bodies, we will compute the variable 'Metabolic.by.mass' by dividing 'Metabolic.rate' by 'Body.mass.g' and use this variable as our primary predictor instead of 'Metabolic.rate'."
MethJust,"Based on this analysis, we are not very confident in the normality of the residuals."
RQDef,"(1) This report's main objective is to understand how certain air pollutants, namely ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter, and temperature contribute to mortality rates."
MethJust,"In Figure 3, we see the histogram for the log of death it is still unimodal and skewed left but it appears slightly more normal and less skewed that just the death variable without the logarithm transformation (2)"
MethDef,MU is the true mean total passes for each of the positions.
RQJust,"In general, continents where there are many third-world countries, like Africa have less access to technology, and continents with more advanced countries like Europe could have more, therefore, access to technology might create an association between the number of subscribers and technology."
Res,"When we run ANOVA, the test outputs a test statistic of F= 16.8992, with a corresponding p value of 0."
Int,"This is likely due to, as mentioned before, the time it takes for the forest to recover burnable vegetation after a fire sweeps through, making many large fires in a year more unlikely."
Data,"For this analysis, a sample of all 595 players from the 2010 FIFA World Cup was collected by Opta, a company that collects and offers data on a variety of sports all around the globe."
Lim,"However, in the plot of residuals against our explanatory variable, the residuals seem to be more spread out at the lower values of log(Metabolic.by.mass)."
Struct,"Figure 2 below plots the distribution of our desired response variable, the number of deaths per day in Chicago."
Data,"However, the histogram of temperature seems a bit bimodal, with more of a left skew as analyzed earlier, and the bimodal shape could be explained by drastic changes in weather from winter to summer."
Int,"This suggests that if I fit a linear model of lifespan against metabolic by mass, I will get a negative coefficient."
MethDef,We then conducted a global goodness of fit test to assess our chosen model.
Data,The most popular category is Entertainment (517 out of 1259 accounts fall under the Entertainment category) and the least popular category is Sports (23 out of 1259 accounts fall under the Sports category).
Data,This paper considered the severity of 517 forest fires from the Montesinho Natural Park in Portugal from January 2000 to December 2003.
Lim,Whereas other animals that are not endangered and do not have hunting protections may have shorter lifespans on average after controlling for other relevant animal characteristics.
Data,"Finally, Figure 13 shows a slightly positive correlation between sulfur dioxide concentration and logarithmic death rate, and figure 14 shows a slightly negative correlation between $PM_{10}$ pollution and logarithmic death rate."
Lim,"In order for other studies to build on this work, it is important to look at other variable statistics such as goals made to determine if any of them are related to a soccer player’s position."
Data,"Figure 8, the histogram for this variable, seems to confirm our results from the boxplot, showing the slight left skew."
Struct,Analysis was done to decide the model and variables to use in the model.
Lim,"Because they took the original population data from a website that requires volunteerism, there is a limited randomness in the population."
MethDef,"To determine whether the pollutants are associated with mortality, we fit a model that uses only temperature as a feature without the pollutant variables - we will compare this model to our best model to validate the association between pollutants and mortality."
Res,We are 95% confident the mean number of non-accidental deaths on a 70 degree day with the lowest amount of recorded pollutant levels will be between 105.89 and 112.64 deaths.
Data,"Looking closer at the relationship between the deaths and time, we can see that it appears to fluctuate sinusoidally depending on the time of year, shown in Figure 5"
Res,"Specifically, the lagged PM10 and ozone concentration variables where the two atmospheric pollutants most associated with mortality while sulfur dioxide has a smaller relationship with mortality."
Int,"Because the plot isn’t very linear, we cannot conclude that there is a relationship between costs and duration."
Res,This calculation led to a result of 4.68 deaths.
Data,"The primary focus will be on the variable viewsPerVideo, a quantitative variable that measures how many views each video garnered on average for the account in question."
Res,"Because the p-values for the covariates were all less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis."
MethDef,"The second model, which we refer to as the lagged model, uses the lagged covariates (7 day averages) in place of the unlagged variables."
Data,"After analyzing the boxplots of our key variables, we also wanted to look at the histograms for EDA, and as seen in the histograms above, our graphs seem to confirm our analysis from the boxplots, that the data is right-skewed for our air pollutant variables."
Data,"The primary predictor variables are time defined as a number of days before or after December 31, 1993, pm10median which is the median concentration of particulate matters with diameters less than 10 micrometers in milligrams per cubic meter, o3median which is the median concentration of ozone in parts per billion, so2median which is the median concentration of sulfur dioxide, and tmpd which is the mean temperature in Fahrenheit."
MethDef,We first construct a linear model analyzing the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan using our log-transformed data.
Data,"In addition, weekly average values for each variable are also given as ""lag-variables"""
Int,"This can be seen through the fact that Japan is a developed country, yet has far less viewsPerVideo on average than Ukraine a developing country."
Data,"There are 5,114 observations of the variables below: death (response) - The number of non-accidental deaths on that date time - The date of observation, given as the number of days before or after December 31, 1993 pm10median - The median density of PM10 pollution."
Context,"The objective of this study is to determine which pollutants are most strongly associated with increased deaths, if they exist, and whether it's reasonable for Mr. Jorgensen to fund research to reduce the level of these pollutants in his environment."
Context,Managers and coaches for international teams are constantly looking to evaluate playing time amongst their players and how their teams are performing in order to constantly improve.
Int,"Consequently, it seems that these two covariates have the strongest association with the outcome, the number of deaths, since the outcome varies the most for different values of these covariates."
Int,We could not find a significant relationship between income level and drug use.
Int,"In our later analysis, we will probably find the relationship of the two variables to be the following: as predictor variable (Metabolic by mass) increases, response variable (Maximum Longevity) would decrease (6)."
Data,We will use the log-transformed death variable for the rest of our analysis.
Res,"The confidence interval reported from this was (107.38, 111.65)"
RQJust,These differences in proportion informally suggest a relationship between sex and smoking habits.
Lim,"For further research, data analysts can look into how BodyInjury impacts the amount to TotalDamages because it is possible that those who have body injuries can receive more damages for medical reasons."
Data,This is the amount of energy used per unit of body mass.
Struct,Now we look at the actual data we are working with.
Res,"When we look at the zoomed in version of Figure 3, we can predict that the correlation coefficient is very low."
Data,We will focus on SampleMDRB and PatientMDRB.
RQDef,"To answer our research question, we will be building models to explore the relationship between the response variable $Age.log$ and the major explanatory variable $Metabolic.log$."
Int,"Given that the original lifespan of a crab-eating raccoon, 19 years, is within this interval we can not confidently conclude that reducing the metabolic rate of Jorgensen’s pet by 50% will result in a lifespan greater than its original one without the metabolic rate reduction (3)."
Data,"Other than the outlier, the relationship between the log of deaths and the pollutants appear to be relatively constant with no obvious positive or negative slope."
Res,Lagged temperature also appears to be associated with mortality given the relatively steep slope of its partial repsonse function.
RQDef,"Specifically, Jorgensen tasked to us to determine whether slowing the metabolic rate increases lifespan and whether this relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan is non-linear."
MethJust,"For “often”, there are only 20 people, which isn’t larger than 30."
RQDef,"Since DMC and DC are relatively similar measures, it can be easy to assume that their relationship is going to have a moderate to strong relationship, as categorized by the R value."
Res,"Therefore, we failed to obtain sufficient evidence required in order to reject our null hypotheses."
RQJust,"Because of this, it seems probable that the population of users between 30 and 65 could make up a majority of the users."
Lim,It would be interesting to see whether channels that have predominantly minors as their viewing audience get more views than channels that have predominantly adults as their viewing audience.
RQDef,I hypothesize that certain categories receive more views on average as different people have different interests and some of those interests may be more common across a larger population.
MethDef,"Also, to facilitate the idea that the effect of pollution may propagates over time, we create the lagged variables, $lag_tmpd$, $lag_pm10$, $lag_ozone$, $lag_so2$"
Int,"While we may suffer from more health issues as we are older, it doesn’t necessarily mean a longer duration of treatment."
Data,"Our primary focus will be on the variable views, a quantitative variable measuring the total number of views a thread has."
RQDef,"In this report, we will try to explore this idea and answer the following research question: How is lifespan related to metabolic rate."
MethDef,The log-transformed variables are stored in a separate data frame.
RQDef,The first being whether slowing the metabolic rate may increase lifespan.
Context,"During my free time, I often watch youtube videos to relax."
Lim,"(3) One of the major limitations to our analyses is that the model we chose had a very low p-value, meaning that its covariates do not sufficiently model the response variable and that a saturated model is preffered."
Struct,We can now turn to the formal hypotheses as we have summarized and explored Shots Attempted.
Lim,The choice of seed also appeared to impact the numbers and results.
Data,"Our research questions [stated in the next section] will also include posts, age, and forum."
RQDef,Our final analysis aims to find the relationship between doing drugs and how fit you are.
MethJust,We also get our standard errors: 22.14733 without lagged variables and 21.62520 with lagged variables (2)
Other,This means that the mean is greater than the median.
Struct,The following figure displays a contingency table for proportion for each group.
Int,"However, we did not find enough evidence to determine that position affects the amount of time on the field that a player is given."
Int,"As such, our hypothesis appears to be contradicted by the data."
MethJust,"The respective standard deviations for diversity in each group are 0.748 and 0.894, which are within a factor of 2 and therefore close enough."
Context,This should not only help YouTubers gain an understanding of ways to increase view counts but could also help YouTube improve their algorithm in suggesting videos to different viewers across the world.
Int,Another might be that the outliers had an unduly-large effect on the mean and distribution ranges.
Data,"Log-deaths is highest in the winter months and then decreases into the summer months, only to rise again back into winter."
Context,"The other one created his account during his sophomore year of high school, focused mainly on entertainment, and has uploaded more videos."
MethDef,"To measure this, we will need to conduct an inferential test and we will choose an alpha value of 1%."
Lim,A possible workaround would be to run the code we used over a variety of different seeds.
Int,These results suggest that using a 7-day average gives better predictions and that the number of deaths may be more correlated to the amount of pollution over the past several days rather than pollution on the same day alone.
Data,"$tmpd$ and $lag_tmpd$ follows similar bi-modal distribution, and they have the very similar mean (around 50.2) and median (both 51) (1)"
Lim,"Lastly,while our sample size was sufficient, we would have more accuracy with a larger sample of days."
Data,It shows that 'death' is cyclical and reaches peaks during the winter.
Int,There is slight increase in area as ISI increases.
Int,"We can argue that because official sport games are aired live on TV for free, there wouldn’t be a reason to create many channels to air games."
Data,"As seen on Table 1 above, the sample means of age for drug use are slightly different."
Other,"The two quantitative variables here are subscribes (the y-axis), and videoUploads (the x-axis)."
Context,There are numerous factors that affect the numbers of subscribers of any youtube channels.
Struct,"These statistics provide means, mediands, and ranges for the data that will be informative when making inferences and building our model."
Res,The 95 % confidence interval of log(Metabolic.by.mass) is between -0.4558601 and -0.3440440.
Int,"A more reliable casual statement, on the other hand, could be drawn using Model 1.2."
Struct,"Having summarized the variable, we now turn to the formal hypotheses."
Res,"In all three scenarios, we did not obtain p-values that were less than our alpha level (0.05)."
Data,"The dataset we are examining comes from a site called Social Blade which tracks analytics that are useful to Youtubers such as number of subscribers, number of views, and the average number of views per video."
Int,"In the context of the data, it is reasonable to say that a lack of drug use is seen in physically well people."
Lim,The diagnostics suggest that I could fit a more flexible model to better explain the data.
Lim,"Additionally, it is worth noting that there are 251 data points with no value for pm10median which will affect the analysis."
Int,"Through my study, I can only conclude that lower metabolic rate is associated with longer lifespan."
Data,(5) We also see four outliers with around 225 - 400 deaths (much greater than the apparent average of about 150 deaths)
Res,"In addition, another way to analyze spread would be standard deviation, which in this case, is 64.046."
MethDef,"To compare the two models, we used a 5-fold cross validation."
Data,"In the following report, ""lifespan"" represents the log transformed lifespan, and ""metabolic by mass"" represents the log transformed metabolic by mass."
Data,"From this table, it can be seen that there is variability within the playing time for different positions."
Int,So Preston Jorgensen might not want to spend his fortune to reduce pollution this much.
Res,"Our analysis found that there is a generally high correlation between the age of the channel and the number of people subscribed to it, which was expected."
Int,"Unfortunately, you cannot conclude that reducing pollutants would definitely cause mortality to decrease because the analysis done here does not prove causation, only association."
Data,It is a “curated database of age- ing and life history in animals” that was “primarily developed for comparative biology studies”.
Struct,The variable of age was already somewhat explained in the Dataset section above.
Context,"In the modern world, video streaming technologies consistently maintain an enormous sense of popularity."
Int,"Last, we use a chi-squared test to conclude that there is an association between drug usage and relationship status."
RQDef,"Even though it seems intuitive that channels with a greater amount of subscribers would mean there is a larger following base, resulting in a higher viewsPerVideo count, that may not always be the case."
RQDef,The first research question will examine if a relationship exists between the relationship status and users’ age.
Lim,"However, when plotted against the lagged PM10 and sulfur dioxide concentration, the residuals may be heteroskedastically distributed such that the residuals fan out from the right to the left."
MethJust,"Therefore, in terms of MSE, model2 performed better than model1 but the difference in MSE is rather minimal(3)"
Res,"For the crab-eating raccoon specifically, their normal metabolic rate is 0.002231034 (normal scale, not log scale)."
Data,This makes viewing the relationships more clear as opposed to the original variables.
Struct,This is a chart representation of the mean age of each category of drug taking frequency.
Data,"Meanwhile, temperature and pollutants appear to have a mostly negative correlation with 'death', with the exception of $SO_2$"
RQDef,"The analysis focused on the distribution of total damages for plaintiffs for a sample of 1836 cases and examined the potential relationship with demanded damages, and type of claim."
Struct,We will start by exploring our predictor variables.
Context,"Many great journeys were taken to try to achieve this great feat, such as trying to discover the mystical Fountain of Youth or the Holy Grail."
Data,"(3) In our problem, the response variable is 'Maximum.longevity.yrs', the maximum lifespan in units of years."
MethDef,"To then test the relationship between category and views graphically, we use a side-by-side boxplot diagram (figure 3 below)."
Struct,Figure 1 below displays a boxplot of playtime for each position.
Res,"As the curve suggests, we observe that the most curved variable is O3"
Struct,Below is the column of each dataset.
Data,"The data set that will be explored in this report is a sample of a larger set of data collected, using Python, from San Francisco OkCupid (okcupid.com) public profiles of people who had been active within a year of the data collection, which occurred on June 30, 2012, and had at least one profile picture."
Data,The variable total passes is once again a quantitative variable that shows the total number of passes a player made.
Struct,The other three scatterplots depict the log transformation combinations with a linear trend line to help visualize which transformation pair elicits the most linear relationship.
RQJust,Different channels will definitely be shared different amount of times due to popularity that in that specific topic.
Res,"The coefficient on $Metabolic.log$, which is -0.18505, is negative."
MethJust,"Again, we have two categorical data values, so we look to use a Chi-Square test to determine whether or not there is a correlation between smoking and body type."
MethJust,"We note that the group sizes (number of shots attempted for each group shown in the chart above under the variable “n”) are relatively large, our smallest being 36, belonging to the Goalkeepers group."
Data,"To study this hypothesis, we will first note the previous graph of months in which fires occurred (figure 1), which observes that the most fires recorded occurred in August, September, and March, while the least fires occurred in January, May, and November."
Int,"We found that there is a significant relationship between drug use and physical fitness, where a lack of drug use does have a significant relationship with physical well-being."
RQJust,"Also, depending on what age people retire, there may be a slight dip in the 60s-year range."
Struct,(3) We will next show diagnostic plots for this model to determine if it is a good fit.
Context,"In fact, some companies actually pay their writers extra, as an incentive, based on the number of views and shares their article gets."
RQDef,"As the number of people joining YouTube increases, our goal is to analyze which channel category is the most popular."
RQDef,This report will examine age as a demographic on OkCupid profiles and analyze the relationship between age and other variables like income and drug usage.
MethDef,(2) We used 5-fold cross-validation to determine which of the two models better fits the data in terms of prediction error.
Data,The most uploads are from the United States (595 out of 1259 accounts are from the United States) the least amount of uploads are from Thailand and Romania (both individually make up 9 out of 1259 accounts).
MethDef,(2) We can use bootstrapping to the linear model to make a 95% confidence interval for that quantity.
RQDef,Our first question will be to analyze the relationship between the subscriber count of a given category.
Res,We observe that the fitted values have negative correlation with the logged Metabolic Rate by Mass.
Int,We can actually see social normalization of alcohol versus other drugs like marijuana when trying to form this conclusion.
RQDef,Our primary goal of this report is to determine whether pollutants are associated with death rate.
Data,"(1) In figures 7, 8, and 9 we see that averaging the median concentrations of ozone and sulfur dioxide as well as the median density of $PM_{10}$ pollution do not change their distribution, as is expected."
Context,Some recent studies suggest that slowing the metabolic rate could be an answer.
RQDef,"Essentially, we predict that the mean age for users who answered “often” or “sometimes” will be different from the mean age for users who answered “never”."
Data,"The variables tmpd and lag_tmpd ares somewhat bimodal and skewed to the right, and the lag variable for ozone is slightly bimodal."
Data,"Other 8 variables are potential explanatory varaiables including temperature in Fahernheit, O3 median in parts per billion, SO2 concentration median, PM10 median in mg/m^3 with their 'lag' values(1)"
Struct,Below in figure 4 we display the relationship between the 3 pollutants and death rate.
Lim,"A more practical method, on the other hand, would be to use weighted least squares (WLS) instead of ordinal least squares (OLS) in model construction (4)."
Lim,The underlying societal and biological construct of interest may have changed over 20 years.
Res,"Among the six types, rental/lease-related claims receive the least amount of damages on average."
MethJust,"We note that while the Spline model performed better than the linear model in this case, the difference does not seem significant when comparing the MSE and SE."
Struct,Figure 5 plots the fitted values vs the actual values with a y=x line added which represents the case in which the fitted values exactly matched the actual values.
Int,"We did not randomly assign the metabolic rates of the animals, and we could easily be observing some confounding variable."
MethJust,"The residuals are also closely distributed along the theoretical normal quantiles, which suggests that the residuals roughly follow Gaussian distribution."
Context,This question can help creators and YouTuber viewers understand what kind of content will gain more views than others.
Data,This suggests that a higher log(Metabolic.by.mass) will be associated with a lower log(Lifespan).
Res,The last two research questions ended with a lack of significant relationship being found.
MethDef,"In the first model, we are using the non-lagged versions of the predictors and the second model we are using the lagged versions of the covariates instead of the non-lagged versions."
Int,"However, we are not confident to say this is definitely the case, since the difference between the pollution's instantaneous effect and continuing effect is very small and we may get a different answer from a different sample."
MethDef,"Where beta1 represents the true slope of the association between age and income, for the users of OkCupid in San Francisco."
RQJust,(2) So we would expect the effects of pollution extends over time.
Data,"'pm10median' has a slightly right skewed distribution, and a unimodal shape as well with a peak at 0 milligrams per cubic meter."
RQDef,"Additionally, we will look more closely at a specific animal - the crab-eating raccoon - to analyze the effect on its lifespan if we were to reduce its metabolic rate by 50% (1)."
Data,"In addition to measures of air pollution, we also see that the relationships between $death.log$ and $tmpd$ and $time$ appears to be strong (5)"
MethJust,"Based on the plots, we cannot firmly conclude that the residuals are distributed with constant variance and that the residuals are normally distributed."
Res,The prediction returned 114.8476 which is included in our confidence intervals.
Res,"Since this p-value of 0 is less than 0.05, we can reject our null hypothesis."
Struct,Figure 4 shows the bivariate relationships between these lag-variables and our log-response.
Int,"After evaluating several models and variable characteristics, our research led us to the conclusion that a slower metabolic rate does have a significant impact in increasing lifespans."
Data,"We examine species taken from the AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity, which contains information from a species' taxonomy to longevity, body temperature, and metabolism."
Int,Thus the second research hypothesis is confirmed.
Res,"Our model reports that we can expect about 104 (estimate = 103.91) people to die in Chicago, with a 95% confidence interval of (100.14, 107.67), or about 100 to 108 people."
MethDef,"For our analysis, we defined metabolic rate as the amount of energy used per body mass (watts/grams), rather than solely the amount of energy used, to allow for comparisons across different animals of different sizes."
MethDef,"We use ANOVA with the null hypothesis that the mean total passes is the same across all positions, hence we will test the hypotheses."
Context,"Due to the severity of consequences, prevention and containment of forest fires are of viral importance."
MethJust,The usual link function for a poisson GAM is log.
MethJust,"We choose to use the nonparametric method because, as stated in the earlier Model Diagnostics sections, we lack confidence in our model assumptions, and would like to use a robust estimate to compensate."
RQJust,"Recent research suggests that slowing metabolic rate may improve longevity or lifespan, indicating a possible relationship between metabolic rate and immortality."
RQDef,Therefore we believe that America will prove to be the leader in all nine categories within our study.
Lim,Further research should use more up-to-date data that contains records on more kinds of air pollutants.
MethDef,Our null and alternate hypotheses are as follows.
Data,"In addition, 'X' and 'HAGRID' are just ids from the database, 'Body.mass.g' and 'Metabolic.rate' have been transformed into 'Metabolic.by.mass', so these variables are not key variables."
RQJust,"In the scatterplot (below), we struggle to notice any relationship or trend which can elaborate as to how age affects views."
Int,"$O_3$ appears to be most strongly associated with mortality due to there being less uncertainty in the relationship between $O_3$ and mortality for higher values of $O_3$, which means the curvature is likely to be part of the true fit."
RQDef,"(2) To determine whether the pollutants are associated with mortality, I fist fit a model that uses only temperature as a feature, not the pollutants."
Struct,"Next, we look at the model diagnostics of our chosen model and how well it appears to fit."
MethDef,We thus test the following hypothesis.
MethDef,"As discussed previously, because the residual diagnostics for our model did not appear to show any blatant violations, we used the resample residuals technique to bootstrap."
MethJust,"Also, we can use the ANOVA test in this case because since the group sizes( number of players at each position) are relatively large, i.e., greater than 30, with the smallest group size being 36."
Data,"They have similar mean (around -0.64 to -0.66), but the median of $so2$ (-1.2696) appears to be larger than that of $lag_so2$ (-0.8725) (1)"
Lim,"The first aspect to note is that sex is defined as either male or female, thus working from a biological perspective distinguished from sex."
Data,"The variable body type is also a categorical variable describing a person’s physical state (a little extra, athletic, average, curvy, fit, full figured, jacked)."
RQDef,We are interested in discovering what biological factors may be related to lifespan.
Lim,So more data is required.
Res,Chi-square anova test produced p-value of 2.2e-16 which implies the difference between the temperature model and model2 is significant and we reject the null hypothesis(2)
MethJust,Furthermore the residuals plot shows none of the usual elements that would make us suspicious of the fit.
Int,"This aligns with our initial EDA analysis where we hypothesized that $O_3$ appears to have the strongest association with mortality, followed by $PM_{10}$ and $SO_2$"
MethJust,"Other than this minor deviation, our model met all the assumptions necessary and appears to fit well."
Res,"More specifically, ozone seems to have the highest association among the three pollutants studied."
Int,"However, the lack of linearity in the data shows that more subscribers is not likely to lead to higher views."
MethDef,"This model will be as follows: log(Maximum.longevity.yrs) = B0 + s(log(Metabolic.by.mass)), (2) where s() is representativce of the nonlinear smoothing function with degrees of freedom from 3-7."
Struct,"Initially, we observed univariate distributions of these key variables."
MethDef,We can assume that there is going to be a log transformation needed in later regression analysis.
Struct,We will begin our data exploration by looking at the univariate for each of the variables in the dataset.
Context,"Thus, it is controversial to say what should be the appropriate amount of damages."
Int,We saw a strong relationship between the shots attempted and the position due to the fact that each position plays a different role on the field.
MethJust,"Since societal factors are primarily to blame for the number of deaths, we will not include these dates in our data."
MethJust,"Since model2 is still better than model1, we are going to continue using model2(3)"
MethDef,"Similarly, we then test on $H_0:$ the Model 2 is correct versus $H_1:$ the saturated model is correct."
Int,High levels of heat resulted in air pollutants and humidity being increasingly concentrated in the ground level where they have a more detrimental impact to people's health.
Struct,All of the formal conditions that must be met in order to use the Chi-Square Test have been discussed and justified in the first research question.
Res,"However, it is noticeable that the CI calculated using bootstrap is slightly wider than the CI calculated using the SE of fit (7)"
Res,"Among the three kinds of air pollutants, we discovered that the level of ozone is most strongly associated the mortality (1)"
Struct,(3) We will now explore some of the relationships between the predictors and log of the response variable.
Data,"In Figure 3, we see that are high correlations between a number of our variables of interest."
Struct,"Similar to figure 2, figure 3 present a matrix of plots demonstrating the relationship between the response variable and the lagged explanatory variables (4)"
MethJust,"However, the blue line (lagged GAM) seems to better fit the peaks of 'death' than the non-lagged GAM"
RQDef,It determined the potential relationships the play time and position of the players had with the shots attempted.
MethDef,"Based on these reasons, we think it is better to use the CI from bootstrapping."
Data,"Death has a minimum of 69, maximum of 411, median of 114, mean of 115.4189, and standard deviation of 15.2988"
MethDef,"Because we are assuming the residuals are normal, we will sample from the normal distribution with the calculated standard deviation and a mean of 0 to get the new value at each bootstrap iteration."
Data,"Drinking is categorical variable, with seven options to choose from that describes drinking experiences."
Data,"Since the P value is 0, this is less than any reasonable significance level, which means we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is sufficient evidence that the mean playtime in the World Cup differs by position."
Int,"Moving on, we did find an association between playing time and the total passes made."
RQDef,"Since Youtube’s main purpose is to entertain the world, we believe it to be reasonable to hypothesize that the entertainment category would have the greatest amount of channels followed by the gaming category."
RQDef,We hope to investigate if there is an association between playing time and total passes.
Struct,"Table 3 presents a summary of the CI calculated manually (under the assumptions of GAM), and the CI calculated using bootstrap (7)"
MethDef,"For the non-lagged, we call Model 1, we will use a Poisson generalized additive model with a log link, with covariates 'pm10median', 'o3median', 'so2median', 'tmpd', each with a spline smoother with 4 degrees of freedom predicting our response, 'death'"
Data,We have two more supplementary explanatory variables: $Body.mass.g$ and $Temperature$.
RQDef,"Our analysis focused on their relationship between subscriber count and variables such as category, country, account age."
Res,The SE of fit is 0.01934044
Struct,Table 2 indicates the number of youtube accounts located within a particular country.
RQDef,"Our goal in this report is to look into how often all players in the World Cup actually play/participate and how much do these players get their teammates involved in games during the World Cup, not just looking at the star players, and also investigate whether there are other factors that affect the playing time and total passes of players in the World Cup."
MethDef,"(2) According to the exploratory data analysis, a nonparametric model may be more approriate."
Data,"These two other variables, which will be featured in the discussion questions, are the following: “RH” (relative humidity) and “month” (month of the year)."
Lim,"Also, maximum lifespan is an aggregate measure of life expectancy, which means that we only have 1 observation for most species."
Int,"Using this data, we may infer that our initial hypothesis was incorrect and that Entertainment is not the most popular category of video."
Context,"With the newest advancements in technology today, socializing online has become easier than ever."
MethJust,We notice that Model 1.2 minimizes the LOOCV error.
Data,"In this dataset, we will analyze both categorical and quantitative data based off a sample of public user profiles from OkCupid."
Res,"The 95% confidence interval for the mean number of deaths is [4.65,4.70]"
MethDef,The linear model we create is the following: log(Maximum.longevity.yrs) = $beta_{0}$ + $beta_{1}$log(Metabolic.by.mass) (1).
Int,"This could be because increasing the number of variables of the model, increases the complexity and allows for the model to be over-fitted."
MethDef,We start by creating a scatterplot to visualize the relation.
MethJust,The difference between the estimated MSE of prediction error is more substantial between the smoothed spline model with degrees of freedom = 5 and the linear model than between the best spline model and the rest of the spline models.
Int,"This means that health insurances don’t necessarily increase premium costs on the factor of age and gender, but other factors that the data set did not include could factor into the premium costs, such as serious health conditions, or genetics."
Res,"From figure 5, we see that decrease in air pollution (more specifically, $ozone$ and $pm10$) is associated with decreased mortality in Chicago, in general (4)"
MethJust,"To better explain the data through more sophisticated and flexible models, I move on to use smoothing spline to fit the same data."
Data,Our questions will thus incorporate the number of subscribers and views.
Res,"For claims about malpractice or premises liability, there would be quite a few outliers in the data set since the mean is exceedingly greater than the median."
Lim,Modern normalization of alcohol makes the final research question harder to produce an unbiased answer for.
Data,"As mentioned before, DC (Drought Code) is a similar measure to DMC, but without taking humidity into account."
Data,We are given data from the AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity.
Data,O3median is the median concentration of ozone measured in parts per billion.
Res,"The test statistic is t=11.5972, and the p-value is reported as p=0."
MethDef,Ha: beta1<0.
Int,This indicates that there's significant evidence to conclude that the difference in deviance between both models (approximately 112.9 higher for the saturated model) is non-zero.
MethJust,"From table 1, we see that the CV error for Model 2 (178.4199) is less than the CV error of model 1 (194.1933) (2)"
Res,(1) From our analyses we found that there was a significant positive association between atmospheric pollutants and mortality in Chicago during this time frame.
Data,"Africa has the lowest, with the total number of African-based channels ending up at 16."
Struct,These will all be answered in this study.
Data,"Also, $Age.log$ and $Metabolic.log$ seem to roughly follow the normal distribution, which is a desirable feature (4)."
Context,Many people have taken it to websites like YouTube for different goals like education and earning money as reported in the Forbes article: https://www.forbes.com/sites/karenhua/2015/06/23/education-as-entertainment-youtube-sensations-teaching-the-future/?sh=5549b8f247c2).
Int,"This indicates that pollution affects deaths per day beyond the days they are observed, but within the same week."
Context,"YouTube in particular, having garnered even more users this past year as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, remains at the forefront of the video-sharing world."
RQDef,"Our analysis focused on the YouTube channel subscribers in 2018 in different ways, we looked at them geographically and saw how their numbers affect the number of views on a channel."
Int,"If the account’s subscribers increases by one subscriber, they will receive .3172 more views."
Int,"From that data, it appears as though our hypothesis is partially incorrect — while the winter months (November, December, January) does appear to have the least number of fires and the summer months far more, September has almost as many fires as August, May has almost none, and March has a surprisingly high number as well."
Int,"However, the proposition that the effect of air pollution extends over time is more plausible."
Data,"When we look at the graphs stacked in this way it is easier to see that their distributions appear to be inverse in some way, and furthermore that the 'Metabolic.by.mass' variable appears to have a very similar distribution to the response, while the 'Temperature' variable seems to have an inverse distribution to the response (left skewed, unimodal."
MethJust,The results showed that there is a significant difference (p<0.001) between Poisson GLM and Poisson GAM and concluded that using non-linear terms would achieve better results.
Data,"'death' appears to have a unimodal shape with a peak around 120 deaths, with outliers in the higher extremes."
Res,"Upon observing plot 4, we see that the United States holds the account with the largest subscriber count, 27.77 million."
MethDef,Spline smoother terms were applied to all covariates.
Int,We also found that the effect on mortality is not instaneous but rather extends over time to weeks after the initial exposure to certain levels of pollutants.
MethDef,"Because we have minimal information about the residuals of our model and a narrow confidence interval isn't required for our study, we will choose the ""resampling by cases"" bootstrap method with 1000 bootstrap iterations"
Int,"Since the p-value is less than the threshold of .05, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a relationship between doing drugs and body type."
Lim,So we cannot conclude any causation relationship.
Int,"We found that there is a strong relationship between position and playtime, due to each position having varying means of playing times."
Res,"It seems that the variables most associated with deaths in Chicago, our response variable being log-deaths, are month, year and temperature."
Lim,"Another bias is that there existed null values for all variables, which means some data is missing from the sample, which could invalidate the data."
Context,August and September appear to be the highest risk for both.
Lim,"It would also be helpful to use robust variance measures (like sandwich variance, $BMB$) in the inference (4)."
MethJust,"Moreover, we can say that the population standard deviations are about the same by comparing the sample standard deviation ([144.324 / 134.886] < 2)."
Int,"This is because the resampling cases bootstrap assumes nothing about the distribution of the data or its noise, thereby giving less precise and looser bounds for the confidence interval."
Data,"'time' is given as the number of days before or after December 31, 1993"
Data,Other variables of this study include total passes and position.
Data,"When we began with our exploratory data analysis it was critical that we identify the key variables, such as the response variable (maximum.longevity.yrs) and key quantitative predictor variables like metabolic.by.mass."
RQDef,Our goal in the current work is to see which traits and specifics attract more visitors to a discussion forum.
Int,"As this is the case, the predicted slope of -26.582 Watts per grams falls within this interval, and as such we reject the null hypothesis that the true slope is 0 (the null that there is no relationship)."
Data,"The distribution of $lag_ozone$ is quite different from that of $ozone$, as it appears to be bi-modal (1)"
MethJust,"We can see some distinct clustering of datapoints, with no observable linear pattern between the variables."
MethJust,"While we want to explore the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan, we want to make sure that we are staying in the correct unit."
RQDef,We use this to understand how many viewsPerVideo an account can expect to gain based on their subscriber number.
Context,"Overall, this study and the data gathered from it may help to inform advertising companies which types of videos on YouTube to market advertisements on."
RQJust,"Large wildfires, on the other hand, are unlikely to be commonplace, as areas of the forest once burned are less likely to be burned in the near future, while vegetation and other fuel for the flames must recover over time."
Struct,We observe the following contingency table to view relationships between varying levels of drug use and alcohol use.
Lim,It is very likely that some feature other than an animal's metabolic rate plays an important role here affecting the result.
Data,"Lifespan, our response variable, appears to be skewed to the right with the potential for outliers (3)."
MethDef,"Since we are performing a Poisson GAM, we will be using a log-link on the response variable death."
Int,However this does not mean that there is a direct correlation between the ozone pollution and number of deaths.
Struct,"Below is the scatterplot and associated regression line for the relationship between age and income, based on the user profiles in the data."
Lim,"However, we are asked to fit a smoothing spline model to fit the same data."
RQDef,That begs the question if there is a relationship between alcohol usage and other drug usage.
Int,"With this conclusion, we also see that the best position for a player in order to have the most total passes is Defender, followed by Midfielder, then Goalkeeper, and then Forward."
MethJust,To determine which bootstrapping method is appropriate for this data we must refer to our conclusions from examining the residual diagnostics.
Struct,"Now that we have discussed all the variable that came with the database, it is time to mention the new variable we added to the database."
Struct,These models can be seen below.
MethJust,"As for the other potential outliers, nothing particularly notable was able to be found about these dates, and while they may actually be outliers, our definition of such is rather unorthodox and their values are not high enough to be particularly influential like the summer heat wave in 1995"
MethDef,The variable we added is called metabolic.by.mass and we created it by dividing the metabolic.rate by body.mass.g (1).
Res,The mean of this data as previously mentioned is 110.872.
MethDef,"Along with figure 6, we assess our hypothesis with a hypothesis test for the difference in means."
Res,"Additionally, we found that reducing the crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% resulted, with 95% confidence, in an expected lifespan of about 18.76 to 23.07 years."
Res,"From these plots, we can see that o3 and temperature have the largest impact."
MethJust,Keep in mind that the difference bewteen the highest MSE error and the lowest MSE error is about 0.1.
Data,"Stool samples were taken from each patient at various times before and after the transplant, and the samples were tested for MDRB as well as microbiome diversity."
RQDef,Next we must determine whether the pollutants are associated with mortality.
Res,"The correlation between these two variables can be quantified with an R value of 0.682, signaling that their relationship is somewhat strong."
MethDef,I decide that the smoothing spline model with effective degrees of freedom = 6 is the best model for two reasons.
RQDef,Our first question focuses on which video category is the most popular among viewers holistically.
Data,"Other than these, only three observations fall slightly above our winter deaths upper bound with values below 5.25, and two below our summer death lower bound."
Context,"Every four years, soccer teams from countries all over the world come together to play a soccer tournament to determine what country has the best soccer team in the world."
Res,"From the last plot in figure 5, we increase in temperature is very closely associated with a decrease in mortality (4)"
Int,"Therefore, the pollutants are associated with mortality."
Res,"After noting the high median value of Comedy, we can also note that it has the highest third quartile value of 5.437M, as well as the highest upper fence value of all of the categories: 10.164M."
Int,"We can hypothesize that the average DMC is pretty high, considering that the mean is above 100."
Res,This would mean that the equation of the line to predict what the DC would be at a certain level of DMC (or vice-versa) would be ŷ = 254.99 + 2.64x.
RQJust,"As different age groups might have have different rates of risk taking behavior like drugs, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that, on average, different frequencies of drug-taking will have different mean age groups."
Res,"Meanwhile, in the real data, the mean number of deaths on a 70-degree day without any constraints on the pollution is 105.6522, which is smaller than our estimation but within the confidence interval."
Res,"Using Model 1.2, we predict that the maximum life expectancy of a typical crab eating raccoon is 13.86 years, and the maximum life expectancy is 15.76 years for a crab-eating raccoon whose metabolic rate is 50% less than its typical value."
MethDef,We are going to try to fit the model using general additive model which implies we need to consider the reponse variable as log(death rate)(2)
MethJust,This determines that the fit of our chosen model is relatively decent.
Int,"But as TotalDamages increased to 10M, there’s no clear pattern for the data points so it is difficult to predict whether there’s a relationship between the two variables."
Data,"The mean number of total passes was 84.521 passes, with a standard deviation of about 77.31."
Struct,Now we want to explore the key variables we are using to address our research problem.
Res,"We also noticed that most big channels in this study were from the United States, India, and Great Britain, which gives us a glimpse of where potential individuals with a slight interest in Youtube might want to know."
Int,"It is possible that if a portion of the fires is caused by human activity, March may be a time where tourism or related activities occur in the area."
Data,"It is noteworthy that while the $Temperature$ for the majority of the animal subjects seems to center around 310 Kelvins, the density of $Temperature$ seems to reach a small peak at around 290 Kelvins."
RQJust,"In fact, interactive content prompting engagement may cause for a lower viewsPerVideo count despite the large number of subscribers."
Data,The data was scraped directly from www.okcupid.com with a sample size of 1500 users in San Francisco.
Struct,Figure 6 shows the result of log-transformation on the two variables.
RQDef,This project is intended to analyze the existing problem in the distribution of damages and how the results of the analysis may help to relieve the problem.
Data,"Also, we will include $Class$ in our analysis, which allows us to see how the subjects in our dataset are distributed among the 4 classes of animals (Amphibia, Aves, Mammalia, and Reptilia)."
Res,"If its metabolic rate were 50% smaller, its estimated mean lifespan predicted by my model would be 20.77764 years."
Data,"We made the following observations: First, 'lag_o3median', 'tmpd.diff', and 'lag_tmpd.diff' are multimodal, while the rest are unimodal."
Data,"To answer our research question, we will use the $Chicago$ dataset."
MethDef,The first will include the non-lag variables that have data taken on one day.
Lim,Dataset with various regions and locations could enrich the research in the future.
Res,(1) We did find a relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan.
MethDef,"In Figure 5 above, we fit our selected smoothing spline model with 6 degrees of freedom to the log-transformed dataset."
MethDef,"Respectively, Let mtpG, mtpD, mtpM, and mtpF represent the true mean total passes for each position."
Data,"The dataset consists of 1,259 channels from YouTube, sampled until the end of 2018 by Social Blade."
Struct,The histograms in Figure 1 help us with this.
Struct,"Now that we have successfully transformed our response and predictor variables, we will apply 6 different models to the log transformed response and predictor variables to better understand the relationship between log(maximum.longevity.yrs) and log(metabolic.by.mass)."
Data,Those values range from 900 through 1100.
Res,"We similarly get a p-value of 0, which is smaller than 0.05."
RQJust,We can see that the Forward position tends to attempt more shots than the other positions.
Int,However it is worth noting that the actual maximum longevity for this species has a positive residual and the maximum longevity of this species without any manipulation is 19 years.
MethJust,We see from the normal-QQ plot that the residuals do not follow the normal distribution as they significantly deviate from the normal quantiles at the right end.
Int,"The median number of subscribers is 1.9 million (1949612) subscribers, therefore, the evidence we got contradicts our hypothesis that most channels have less than 1 million subscribers."
MethJust,"In this case, if we try to calculate each diagnosis separately, we would not be able to meet the requirements for the chi squared test."
MethDef,"Since we will be using log-deaths in our model and want to determine if time should be a predictor, we will look at log-deaths over time."
Data,Note that for consistency the age calculation was performed on December 31 2018.
Data,"The mean value for diversity is 2.869, with a standard deviation of 0.852."
Res,"After performing the test, we get a test statistic of F = 1.5733 and a p-value = 0.1789."
Res,"Number of counts in September is slightly lower than number of counts in August, and these two counts presumably add up to the majority of counts in the entire year."
Int,The relationship seen between RH an area is stronger than the relationship seen between ISI and area.
Lim,We would think that the all categories of channels would have around the same correlation between account age and number of subscribers since that’s a broad generalizable behavior.
Data,"For instance, in the 'Body.mass.g.log' vs 'Metabolic.by.mass.log' plot, we can clearly see a large cluster of a negative linear relationship and a less sparse negative linear relationship under it."
Other,"However, this is only a preliminary conclusion."
Int,Entertainment accounts are a close second in likelihood of getting high videos.
Int,"We note that the lower bound for this confidence interval is greater than the original average mean lifespan of 19, so the reduction in metabolic rate does seem to be fruitful in reducing the average lifespan for the raccoon."
Data,The mean playtime was 208.864 minutes with a standard deviation of 145.434 minutes.
Lim,"However, due to limitations in our current data, we cannot conclude that high pollutant levels ""cause"" deaths"
MethDef,H0: There is no association between sex and drinking habits (sex and drinking habits are independent).
MethDef,We have Log.maximum.longevity.yrs = -0.28697  Log.metabolic.by.mass + 0.09638  Log.body.mass.g + 0.23651.
Int,"However, this might be misleading due to the higher proportion of athletic non-smokers to total smokers compared to overweight non-smokers."
RQDef,"Now that we have a model proving our assumption, we want to estimate the mean lifespan of the crab-eating racoon if its metabolic rate is 50% smaller."
Data,"Further, there is a spike with many outliers between 1995 and 1996"
Lim,A larger dataset with more observations and more features will help us improve our analysis.
Res,"The reverse is also true: higher metabolic rates lead to higher log(metabolic.by.mass) which correspond to lower maximum life span, or lower log(Maximum.longevity.yrs)."
Data,"The 7 day average, lag_o3median can be described the same way."
Context,"In the modern age, the ability to connect has been made easier, in some respects."
Res,"From this table, we can see that the intersection of variables with the most population in the social drinkers that are average body type."
Res,"Given that our p-value is less than 0.01, we can say that we have statistically sufficient evidence at the 1% level to reject the null hypothesis that the lagged pollutants' coefficients missing in the nested model (model 3) compared to the full model (model 2) are not different from zero."
Res,"(2) If the crab-eating racoon decreased in metabolic rate by 50% while maintaining an average mass, the predicted longevity for this species would jump from approximately 14 years to approximately 18.5 years."
Data,"The mean value is 19.756, with a standard deviation of 8.862."
Struct,These will be addressed later.
RQDef,Our final research question will be to analyze the relationship between subscriber counts and the age of accounts.
Struct,A summarization of the country and viewsPerVideo is show below.
Data,The data we will be using was recorded by a station run by the Braganca Polytechnic Institute and includes the size of the total area burned by the fire and other atmospheric and geographical conditions surrounding the blaze.
Data,"In the histogram shown below, we can see that most of the players attempt a small number of shots (most being less than 3 shots) and the distribution is skewed right with a primary mode of zero."
MethJust,"Fitting the spline model to our log transformed variables (shown in Figure 4), it seems that that it mostly captures the trend of the data points."
MethDef,"Now, we will calculate the deviance for both models and test the hypotheses by doing a chi-square test on the difference in deviances."
Int,"With our observational data on deaths and pollutants in Chicago, we can not extrapolate our findings to other cities and we can not make a causal claim that significantly reducing the pollutant levels to the lowest measures ever recorded will reduce the mean death rate for Chicago on a 70 degree day."
Res,"We also discovered that some key variables, like ozone had a greater impact on mortality than other air pollutant variables."
MethJust,Both varibles appear to be heavily right skewed.
Data,"However, we must note that the log-transformed metabolic rate distribution is slightly skewed to the left although it appears significantly more normal than without the transformation (5)."
Data,Thus we will also use 'Log.body.mass.g' in our further analysis.
Res,"(3) Using a pivotal confidence interval with 1000 bootstrap iterations, we find the 95% confidence interval for this particular quantity is [19.05, 23.78]."
Data,We see that body mass and metabolic rate seems to have opposite correlation with our response variable.
Data,"Our explanatory variable we will call Metabolic.by.mass, which is the amount of energy used per unit of body mass (W/g)."
Data,We have information on a sample of 1259 different Youtube users (Youtubers).
Res,The regression equation also suggests that each post results in 44.47 views.
Data,"Looking at these time series plots, we can see a seasonal oscillation of deaths and log deaths across time."
Lim,"The side effect of this is that it results in a wider confidence interval than perhaps is necessary, which impacted our final conclusion about the crab-eating raccoon (3)."
RQJust,"Because of this, it seems probable that the population of users between 30 and 65 could make up a majority of the users."
Int,"Moreover, we concluded that this relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan was nonlinear."
MethJust,Females: (385)(0.706) = 271.8 ≥ 10 (385)(1- 0.706) = 113.2 ≥ 10.
Res,"Before PM10 = 20, we have more data and narrow error bounds, but the relationship levels off and appears closer to having a zero slope, indicating the association with log-deaths is not strong."
Res,"The p value I get is 0, which means that I have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the saturated model fits significantly better than my model."
Data,"'tmpd.diff' and 'lag_tmpd.diff' are left skewed, while the others are right skewed."
Lim,"Secondly, the data was obtained via a volunteered sample, therefore, our findings could be biased."
RQDef,We hypothesize that there will be an association between sex and smoking habits.
Data,"so2median - The median concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO2), which is produced as a byproduct of combustion, such as by burning coal, sulfur dioxide is both toxic and a contributor to acid rain."
Data,"In addition, the correlation between 'death' and 'lag_tmpd.diff' is the strongest one."
MethJust,"This allows us to place more priority on severe wildfires, which are the ones that are a cause of concern."
RQDef,Question 2: Does the age of a thread affect the count of views.
MethDef,"(6) Because the residual diagnostic plots look good, resampling residuals appears to be the most appropriate route to take because the plots do not appear to violate homoscedasticity and there does not seem to be strong normality violations from the diagnostic plots."
MethDef,"To do this, we run a nonparametric bootstrap with 1000 iterations to estimate a 95% pivotal confidence interval for the expected number of deaths overall."
RQJust,"For 'log_death' and 'lag_pm10median', 'lag_o3median', 'lag_so2median', and 'lag_tmpd', the coefficients are -0.164, -0.285, 0.137, -0.475, each more extreme than -0.015, -0.192, 0.099, -0.401, the correlation coefficients when using the daily version of the variables."
Int,"We cannot conclude a direct causation effect, only association between metabolic rate and lifespan."
Struct,"In figure 1, we can see a histogram and boxplot for the lifespan of animals."
Data,"Goalkeepers were the least popular position, only being 36 (or 6%) of the 595 players."
MethDef,"For our analysis, we shifted the pollution variables such that they contain negative values."
Int,"Overall, we did not find a strong relationship between category and subscribers nor views."
Int,"Overall, we were unable to see a strong relationship between viewsPerVideo and country of origin, as well as viewsPerVideo and subscriber count."
Data,Any small fire that burned less than 0.1 ha has been capped at 0.1 ha.
Int,The final research question concluded that there is not a significant relationship between drinking and drug use.
Res,The MSE of Model A (with not lagged variables) is slightly larger than that of Model B (with lagged variables)
Struct,A summary of Model 1 is as below in table 1 (1).
Res,The p-value turned out to be 0
MethJust,The results of the cross validation are as follows: we found that the spline models outperformed the linear model in terms of estimated MSE of prediction error across all the degrees of freedom.
MethJust,"(1) Because the relationship between lifespan and metabolic by mass appears to be moderately linear, I start by constructing a linear model."
Res,"Based on this confidence interval, we are 95% confident that the mean of non-accidental deaths fall between 104.52 to 113.8 on a 70 degree Chicago day with the minimum values of the three pollutants (PM10, SO2, Ozone) in the data."
Data,"In this study, we will be analyzing the relationship or metabolic rate on lifespan using data collected the AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity."
Data,"We see from the prior analysis that the distributions of the response variable and the major explanatory variable are both right-skewed, and the relationship between them is not linear."
MethDef,"In this study, we will be analyzing metabolic rate divided by the body mass of the species in grams to assess the amount of energy used per unit of body mass, allowing us to accurately compared the lifespans of animals who are different sizes by removing the effect size might have on metabolic rate."
MethDef,We can see how confident we are about our estimate by bootstrapping.
RQDef,Billionaire Preston Jorgensen is interested in discovering which pollutants are associated with increased deaths to learn how to extend his lifespan.
Int,"The distributions are sufficiently similar, that we do not have enough evidence to back up our hypothesis and state a valid claim that there is a relationship between category and views."
Data,"However, when we look at the lagged time series in figure 11 we can see that all pollutants and termperature variables exhbit a seasonal oscillating pattern."
Res,"Through extensive analysis, we determined that there exists a general negative relationship between lifespan and metabolic rate, where lower metabolic rates do generally correspond to longer lifespans."
Int,"Using the un-lagged covariates and lagged-covariates, we found that the effect of pollution on mortality rate extends over time."
Res,This inverse trend between metabolic rate by mass and lifespan was later confirmed by our chosen model (best based on lowest prediction error).
Struct,This plot shows log-deaths as a time series with an overlaid 4-week moving average line.
MethJust,Cluster of points we can see in Figure 5 is gone and distributions are flattened throughout the transformation (5).
RQDef,This research question explores whether or not drug use is an indicator of income.
MethJust,We didn’t test the inclusion of body mass (grams) into the models as this would have surely resulted in multicollinearity due to our interpretation of metabolic rate as the amount of energy used per body mass (watts/grams).
Struct,We define 2 key variables.
Context,"Our client, Preston Jorgensen, is interested in extending his life by examining the relationship between pollutants and death rate."
Int,Our model points out that the effect of pollution affects the death rate over the next few days.
Struct,"(1) Next in our modeling analysis, we will determine which of these two models best fit the data by calculating each model’s prediction error and standard error using cross-validation techniques."
Data,"(1) The data we are using is from Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity, which is a ""curated database of ageing and life history in animals"" that was ""primarily developed for comparative biology studies""."
Data,"The key variables we will be exploring will be air pollutants (i.e., PM10, Sulfur Dioxide, Ozone), mean temperature, their 7 day averages (lagged), and non-accidental deaths across the 4,012 observations in the subset of the Chicago air quality dataset."
RQJust,"Second, the correlations between 'death' and the lagged variables are larger than their corresponding not lagged variables."
Int,We then discovered a weak relationship with a slightly positive slope between ISI and area.
Struct,"With that being said, we want to examine the relationship between the two key variables: Metabolic Rate and Maximum Longevity."
Data,"The mean number of subscribers was 3201757 subscribers, and the standard deviation of the subscribers was 3556605 subscribers."
Context,Jorgensen also noted that he wants the crab-eating raccoon as a pet to keep him company during his potentially immortal life.
Int,"This relationship was not the strongest, but the players that had the most play time were often the ones with the most attempted shots."
Data,"On the other hand, there seems to be no relationship with SO2"
Data,"The histogram of the log of the deaths variable indicates that the variable is fairly normally distributed, with the majority of the data lying between 4.5 and 5 log deaths but there are several higher outliers."
MethDef,We used a pairs plot to explore the relationship between predictor variables and the response variable.
MethDef,"As a result, we will remove this outlier to avoid bias in our regression fit."
Lim,"It is plausible that the older the channel, the more views they gain per video since they have been around for a longer time and have gained a more loyal following and viewership."
Data,"In order to formalize this hypothesis, we will focus on the average number of shares over all 6 channels."
Struct,"Figure 6 shows the scatterplots of air pollutants (i.e., pm10, ozone, sulfur dioxide) and temperature against log of accidental deaths."
Int,It seems that spending a fortune to decrease is not recommended because our prediction is not a lot lower than the median death which is 114
Data,"In this World Cup, the most popular position was Midfielder, being 228 (or 38%) of the 595 players."
Data,"As for the supplementary explanatory variables, $Temperature$ follows a left-skewed distribution with a mean of 308.1 Kelvins and a median of 309.4 Kelvins (2)."
Data,"Our last explanatory variable temperature, is left skewed with a mean temperature of about 50 degrees fahrenheit."
RQDef,"That being, he also tasked us with determining the average lifespan of an animal with the crab-eating raccoon's characteristics but with a 50% smaller metabolic rate given that Jorgensen would fund research to reduce the pet's metabolic rate by 50% (1)."
MethJust,"As no assumptions are violated for Model 1.2, we could (should) also use parametric bootstrap."
Int,"Ultimately, the research from the data set cannot conclude that there is a relationship between medical history, specifically age and gender, and claim costs."
Lim,"It can very likely be the case that if we were to add more animal groups, these assumptions may be broken with more clusters of animals added."
Data,We will focus primarily on the variable subscribers.
MethJust,"Because Mr. Jorgensen's goal is to understand the relationship between pollution and mortality, and whether or not he should invest in reducing pollution, our response variable in our analysis will be 'death'"
Int,"Also, we conclude that the relationship between metabolic rate and maximum lifespan is non-linear."
Other,This insight gives us valuable preliminary information before we begin building our model and answering Jorgensen's research questions (5).
Context,The questions we seek to answer do not explicitly ask us to account for this difference.
Res,"Due to the fact that our pValue is more than 0.05, we do not have significant evidence to reject our null hypothesis."
Data,"The relevant variables include sex (m/f), drinks (very often, often, socially, rarely, desperately, not at all), smokes (yes, sometimes, when drinking, trying to quit, no), and drugs (never, sometimes, often)."
Struct,We can better see these possible differences in a chart as included below.
RQDef,We also plan to answer whether the relationship between the metabolic rate and lifespan is nonlinear.
Other,That means the mean is higher than that.
MethDef,"However, for now, we can combine the people who said “sometimes” and “often” under the same group of people who are drug users, so we can move on with the ANOVA test."
Context,Our health insurance premiums are based on the predictions of the potential medical costs that may incur in the future based on our medical history.
Res,The scatter plot did not show a strong relationship between TotalDamages and Demanded damages due to large variation in values for each damage.
Context,"It is widely acknowledged by doctors and epidemiologists that extreme temperature leads to a higher mortality rate, and it is believed by many (though not proved officially) that air pollution could impose threats on the heath."
Lim,"Future examinations can characterize other variables such as personalities and hobbies, which could help OkCupid develop features that would increase the chances of people finding someone with similar interests and personalities as them."
MethDef,This data will be converted into actual dates.
MethJust,We decided to use smoother terms for the predictors because of the predictors didn't appear to have a linear relationship with the response variable.
Lim,"But, as shown in 4.5, this is not true."
Data,We will use this variable throughout the report instead of metabolic rate ('Metabolic.rate') to indicate amount of energy used per unit of body mass which allows us to compare between animals of different sizes (1).
Struct,We plotted the residuals against each predictor in the model along with the fitted values.
Data,We note that there are a series of large outliers in 'death' right after the year 1995
Lim,"There is also the fact that this chicago data is limited to cases in chicago, as well as the key variable that we looked at."
Data,"As for the pollutants, pm10median seems slightly right-skewed with a few outliers of very high density, o3median appears to be similarly right skewed with outliers, and lastly so2median seems to normally distributed with slight right-skewedness and many high density outliers."
Context,"In 2010, the World Cup was held in South Africa and the last match was between the Netherlands and Spain."
MethDef,"As such, the linear model is the best model for estimating the relationship between metabolic rate per unit body mass and lifespan of a species."
Res,The correlation coefficient calculated is 0.037 which also corresponds to no relationship.
Res,"According to the bar graph above, there are 257 entertainment channels in the Americas, which is the highest number of channels overall across all of the continents."
Data,"Looking at o3median, we see it is unimodal and the distribution is right skewed as well."
Res,"To further examine the linear relationship, we observe from the following table 5 that the simple regression line has an y-intercept of about 25.9ha and a slope of about -0.3."
Data,Metabolic stands for metabolic by mass in the following linear regression model.
Res,This is the case even though our model estimated the lifespan of a crab eating raccoon to be higher (increase from 19 to 20.1) if its metabolic rate was cut in half (3).
MethJust,"That being said, once again, the standard error is lower for the lagged model, thus this is the model that we will be using for our results."
Res,"On the other hand, for a crab-eating raccoon whose metabolic rate is 50% less than its typical value, our model predicts that its expected maximum lifespan is expected to be 20.77763 years, which is 43.2% higher than that of a typical crab-eating raccoon and 9.35% higher than that of the crab-eating raccoons in our data (2)."
Struct,We will first examine the key variables individually.
RQDef,Based on this information we’ll estimate the mean death rate given the level of each pollutant was lowered to match the lowest value ever recorded.
Res,"The p-value is 0, which suggests that we reject $H_0$"
Data,Standard deviation is greatest for people who answered “never”.
Data,The database we are using contains information on the ageing and life history of 347 species of animals collected across hundreds of scientific papers.
Res,"After conducting the hypothesis test, we found the p-value to be very small(< 2e-16)"
Res,We also predict that the mean estimate for this value would be 109.21 deaths.
MethDef,"Using our GAM model with the lagged terms, we want to see how well the model fits in general."
Lim,"To run ANOVA, we needed at least 30 people in each group for a sufficient sample size, however, there were only 20 people who answered “often” for drug usage, and thus we did not reach the necessary 30 people."
MethJust,"We also looked at a normality plot of the residuals (figure not shown), which indicated that the residuals on either end do not follow the normal distribution very closely."
Data,"Meanwhile, from Figure 1, we saw the data contains many outliers."
MethDef,"Before testing the relationship between the two factors, we will first visualize our data through a boxplot."
Data,"Our primary explanatory variable is 'Metabolic.rate', which is the typical resting metabolic rate in Watts of the species."
MethDef,"Based on the table, we can generate the formula that predicts the number of subscribers at a certain accountAge."
Data,It appears that most of the animals in our dataset do not live extremely long lives.
RQDef,Our main objective is to identify which pre-conditions to a forest fire most contribute to its severity and the seasons in which they occur.
Data,Permission was obtained from OkCupid president and co-founder Christian Rudder to use this data under the condition that the dataset remains public.
Context,"Their occurrences can cause serious harm to economic development and ecological condition as well as endangerment of both humans and animals (as reported by Cortez and Morais, 2007)."
MethDef,We also display a log-transformation of death below since we will be performing Poisson GAMs with the log link when generating our models.
MethDef,"Instead, a more reasonable model to choose is a generalized additive model to include both 'log.metabolic.by.mass' and 'Temperature' with some smooth functions."
MethJust,This is important as we develop our models because this may invite us to look into transformations on these particular variables and pay attention more closely to the assumptions of relevant models.
Data,"Our response variable in the study will be the number of deaths, with the other key variables as covariates."
MethDef,(1) We conducted a global goodness-of-fit test on the model we chose.
Res,"The mean is adjusted by the outliers, and there were many outliers."
Data,"(2) Our response variable is 'Maximum.longevity.yrs', which represents maximum lifespan in years."
Lim,It would have also been helpful if the dataset contained information on different types of air pollutants that are known to impact health such as nitrogen dioxide and indoor radon.
MethJust,We can see that the a df parameter equal to 5 has the minimum mean squared error of 0.3577763 and a standard error of 0.027661.
Res,"Since our p-value of 0.1789 is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis."
Int,"We are able to establish a clear link between longevity and metabolic rate (adjusted by mass), but it is crucial to the correct interpretation of this report that we infer no causal implications from this data, which is not experimental."
Data,"The ozone variable is rather uniform between -15 and 10 parts per billion, but has a slightly right-skewed distribution with there being some higher outliers."
Context,Should Jorgensen spend his enormous fortune to try to reduce pollution this much.
Lim,A limitation of our analysis was the sample size.
MethDef,"We graphically investigate the relationship between Country and Category with a Bar Chart, as shown in figure 2, below."
Int,"This is probable as the longer a thread has been posted, there is more time for it to reach a larger audience."
Struct,This is in part due to the assumptions that we use for the bootstrap.
Struct,Figure 2 below displays a boxplot of shots attempted for each position.
Data,"Notably, the often group has a size of n=20, while the other groups have a sample size of at least a couple hundred."
Res,It is worth noting that this interval contains our estimate of 20.11787 years.
MethJust,"From figure 2 and 3, we see that the relationships between $death.log$ and explanatory variables (both lagged and non-lagged) does not appear linear."
Data,"The dataset contains 5,114 observations."
Res,"Lastly, we predicted that the death rate for Chicago on a 70 degree day with record lows of each pollutant would be around 107"
MethJust,We found that the model that produced the lowest error was a spline with 6 degrees of freedom (3).
MethJust,"However, we decided to overlook this because the sample of individuals with an OkCupid account could be similar to a random sample from the general population."
Res,A raccoon that has a rate 50% smaller than the given rate would have a metabolic rate of 1.294 Watts.
Struct,"Figure 8 contains plots depicting the relationship between each lagged variable in our model and the outcome, 'death', with the dashed lines representing uncertainty."
MethDef,"In order to test these hypotheses, we will run a one-sample mean t-test."
Context,"During the World Cup, all the attention is on the star world class players like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, who play all the minutes in every game drawing the attention from every viewer all over the world."
Data,Subscribers is a quantitative variable indicating how many people are subscribed to each account.
Data,There seem to be a positive non linear relationship between temperature and O3 median.
MethJust,"As this is impossible and the maximum value of metabolic rate in the dataset is 0.04, having an intercept for the models would not make sense."
Res,"We are given a confidence interval of [-0.0004, 0.0161], with 0.008 fitting into the interval, making it a reasonable supposition."
MethDef,We will use MSE to further compare the linear model with spline models.
Data,The histogram shows that temperature has a slightly left skewed and non-normal distribution.
Data,"We can see in figure 5 that there seems to be a strong correlation of data in the bottom left of the graph, signifying that the lower the metabolic rate per unit body mass, the shorter the lifespan."
RQDef,"In this project, we looked at possible correlations between smoking, drinking, and doing drugs on body type, or specifically how fit an individual is."
Data,(4) An interesting trend in these models is that the ozone and temperature data appears to seasonally osciallating over the years while the sulfur dioxide and pm10 polluntants appear to be relatively constant over time with no distinguishable pattern.
Lim,The data set was not large enough to argue that there is a correlation between medical history and claim costs.
Struct,"In Figure 1 below, we see a histogram of each."
RQDef,"Overall, our report focused on the Duff Moisture Content and analyzed it’s relationship with other variables like temperature and the Drought Code."
Int,Our analyses could not conclude whether the effect of pollution was instantaneous or extends over time.
Data,We are also interested in using the metabolic rate of animals.
RQJust,"(We could postulate that views simply are higher with posts, since more posts can only come from a thread with a higher view count and interaction rate already)."
Struct,"Before formally testing the hypothesis, we will compare the differences in proportions between these three categorizations within the drinking variable among males and females."
MethDef,"(2) Finally, we performed bootstrapping to create a 95% confidence interval to test this lifespan of the raccoon."
Data,"Pm10median has a minimum of -37.3761, maximum of 320.7248, median of -3.5391, mean of -0.1464, and standard deviation is 19.256"
Res,"In addition, the mean for the distribution of total damages is about $213101.43 and the median is $ 7795.00."
RQDef,"In order to facilitate better central planning and preparation, fire response teams should understand the conditions surrounding a wildfire and its potential scope and damage beforehand."
Data,SampleMDRB is a categorical variable with value 0 if there is no presence of MDRB in the sample stool and value 1 if there is.
Data,"The distribution of $Body.mass.g$ seems to be right-skewed, with a few outliers deviates significantly from the center (2)."
Data,Country is a categorical variable that indicates what country from which the Youtube channel was created in.
Data,The lagged variables are 7-day averages of the original variables (1)
Res,"Overall, we found that there is an association between the continent and the number of subscribers where the minority of subscribers were in Africa."
Res,"In addition, August has the largest interquartile range with a DMC value of 70.1."
Context,"Billionaire Preston Jorgensen would like to understand how pollutants are related to deaths, and search for ways to extend his life."
Int,"From the results of figure 4, it is clear now that although there appears to still be a slightly greater risk of wildfire in March, the severity of those flames is significantly less than that of the latter-summer and early-fall months."
MethJust,"As the prediction error and standard errors for the models of higher degrees of freedom do not change much, we have relatively low uncertainty and as such can be confident in our estimates of the prediction error to say that there is a significant difference between the models."
Struct,We then examine the relationship between variables.
MethJust,Because our constant variance assumption is an issue we can't use our normal parmetric bootstrap method.
Lim,"However, we did investigate the residuals, and so the error caused by the seed was minimized."
MethDef,"To see the relationship between the account age and views per video, we plotted a scatterplot."
Data,tmpd - The mean temperature (Fahrenheit) Each of the variables has a lag-variable counterpart except for time and death.
Data,"As metabolic rate increases, lifespan decreases."
RQJust,The Defender position has the greatest median of 89 total passes while the Midfielder position has a median of 72.5 total passes.
MethDef,(2) Our model is constructed as follows: $sqrt{Lifespan}$ = -26.582  $sqrt{Metabolic Rate per Unit Body Mass}$ + 5.335.
Int,There isn't a direct relationship between costs and duration and there can be additional variables that affected the data such as the reason for the stay.
Data,Our report will use data collected by Social Blade and which is based on the year 2018.
Res,"Looking at the data, we can see that on average, August is the month that has the highest DMC."
MethJust,We decided to use 5-fold cross-validation because we do not have a very large dataset so splitting the dataset into 5 folds is a reasonable amount so that each subset still has enough statistical power.
Data,"To do this analysis, we will do some exploratory data analysis on our key variables: air pollutant variables, temperature, and our response variable death (1)"
Data,"Income varied for each user from 20,000 to 1,000,000."
Context,There have been several significant cases in the last few years that lead to loss of life and property.
MethJust,"As shown in in Figure 6, the model captures the general trend of the data and fits the data quite well."
Data,"It also contains measurements of air quality, or, more specifically, measurements of the median density of $PM_{10}$ pollution which the median density of particulate matter with a diameter of less than 10 micrometers (measured in milligrams per cubic meter), the median concentration of ozone (in parts per billion, ppb), the median concentration of sulfur dioxide (in parts per billion, ppb), and finally 7-day averages of the temperature and all three air pollutants."
Other,"Both are much higher than you might expect by looking at the density plot, likely as a result of the massive scale of the high outliers relative to the scale of the mode itself."
Res,"The distribution is clearly skewed right (tail located on the right side), with a few outliers located at the higher end of views per video (for example, at ~75M, ~85M, and ~215M)."
Res,"Since the p-value of 0 is below the alpha value of 0.01, we reject the null hypothesis."
MethDef,"Since our assumptions are met, we can perform the test at level 0.01."
RQJust,"As did the first two contingency tables, we can observe that males have higher proportions within every single drug category."
Res,"In our study, (1) there is adequate evidence to conclude that atmospheric pollutants, $SO_2$, PM10, and $O_3$, are associated with mortality, and $O_3$ has the strongest association."
Int,"Since the P value is 0, this is less than any reasonable significance level, which means we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is sufficient evidence that the mean total passes in the World Cup differs by position."
RQDef,The first possible relationship we will discuss is between sex and drinking habits.
MethJust,"Looking at the results, we find that the original GAM appears to have a higher 5-fold cross-validation MSE and higher standard error than the lagged GAM"
Int,This makes sense as we would expect that many more covariates besides pollutants and deaths would be needed to adequately model non-accidental deaths including a host of other weather/environmental factors.
Int,"These associations are non-linear, indicating that a change in levels of these pollutants wouldn't be proportional to a change in non-accidental deaths on a particular day."
Int,"On the other hand, since YouTube can be a subjective and opinionated platform, people are less likely to seek YouTube for the purpose of obtaining information regarding “News & Politics”."
Int,This means the expected difference in the square root of the lifespan of two subjects of the same species that happen to have a square root of metabolic rate per unit body mass differing by 1 Watt per gram is -26.582 Watts per gram.
Int,"Because this is much greater than our significance value of alpha=0.05, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null, and thus do not have sufficient evidence to say that there is a negative relationship between age and income."
MethJust,"Through a dispersion test, we found the response's mean does not equal its variance, which leads to a p-value of 0"
MethDef,We varied the degrees of freedom in our smooth spline model to test which level of complexity would yield the best fit while not changing the overall shape of the non-parametric model.
Res,"As for the curve of ozone, there is an obvious increasing trend in the curve."
Res,"We observe the chi-squared value to be 27.07, which in turn indicates a p-value of 0.00755."
Int,"Thus, it would be unwise for Preston Jorgenson to invest large proportions of his money to decrease pollution levels since it would not significantly decrease mortality rate."
Data,"We can also notice that there is quite a right-skew on the distribution, and some outliers in the plot as well."
Res,The ANOVA hypothesis test concluded that the pollutants do have an association with mortality due to the low p-value (less than 0.05)
Struct,(5) We also want to take a look at the other variables in order to better analyze the relationship.
Data,"We have access to 4 possible predictors: 'Metabolic.rate', 'Body.mass.g', 'Temperature', and 'Metabolic.by.mass'."
Data,"Looking at the histograms, we find that death seems to be normally distributed around 100-120 deaths with a few outliers of very high number of deaths."
RQJust,"We suspect that most of our variables are logically dependent on the time of year, such as temperature."
Lim,Montesinho National Park is not representative of all global forests or even of all forests in Portugal.
Int,"Since Model 2 consists of variables that are lagged, we can conclude that the effect of pollution extends over time."
Int,"Additionally, the effect is not a day by day basis, but rather extends over time."
Context,Discussion Forums are spaces online in which many internet users can reflect and discuss on a topic to learn more and to criticize.
Int,"However, Jorgensen cannot conclude that reducing the crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% would cause its lifespan to change."
MethJust,"Since thousands of people are given liver transplants each year, 77 patients is certainly much smaller."
Data,"The variable Country is a categorical variable showing which locations on earth are most famous for each type of Category ( America has the most significant amount of categories out of all Counties except for music, which India holds)."
RQDef,"Since the liver helps to fight off infections, it is reasonable to assume that more severe liver disease leads to higher chances of MDRB infection."
MethJust,"In order to increase the effectiveness of our modeling it was vital that we transformed the key variables to improve normality and linearity, as many of the key variables were strongly skewed prior to being transformed."
Data,"The data that we have on smoking is separated into five categorizations: yes, sometimes, when drinking, trying to quit, and no."
Struct,(6) Taking a look at figure 5 and we can identify some interesting trends.
Struct,"In Figure 1, we can see the histograms for each variable."
RQDef,The first question we explore in this report is to characterize the distribution of subscribers among the different channels.
Int,"These outliers occur on July 13-16 in 1995, which in Chicago's history correspond to a record-breaking heat wave that causes many deaths."
RQDef,"Further, does the effect of pollution happen instantaneously or is there a certain time window that the effect occurs."
RQDef,"We assume then by this reasoning, that because the Sports category is the least frequent out of all, it will also have the the least number of subscribers."
MethJust,MSE for model1 is 0.01328419 and for model2 is 0.0124551(2)
Lim,"Also, it would have been useful to know which animals were classified as endangered species because endangered animals may have some hunting protections such that their lifespans will not be cut short by hunters."
RQDef,"(1) We then wish to determine whether the pollutants, or only temperature are having an effect on our regression model."
Lim,"As such, further research is needed into exactly what causes MDRB infection."
Data,"The data used in this project was sourced from members on OkCupid, who have provided the data on body type, diet, drinking, drugs, education, drugs, and more on 1500 individuals that use OkCupid."
Lim,"We had a very restricted sample of animals as reflected in figure 1, and out of the different classes and orders, it would seem to make sense to restrict our data to only animals that are closest to human beings."
RQJust,"These lag-variables seem to be more clearly related to each other than the original variables appeared, but we can consider these associations to be true between both the original and lag sets of variables since they are derived from the same data."
Int,This might be explained by the fact that popularity of channels in terms of view count per video may fluctuate greatly over time as the popularity increases or decreases.
MethDef,We carry out our test at alpha=0.05.
Int,"We found that the pollutants: ozone and Particulate matter, are strongly associated with increased mortality from the dataset."
Data,Throughout our analysis will be focusing on the subscriber count of each channel.
Lim,This would give us better grounds to extrapolate our findings across most if not all US cities.
Data,"Our primary variable that we’ll be observing is drugs, which is a categorical variable describing how often an OkCupid user uses drugs (never, null, often, sometimes)."
Data,Our response variable is the number of non-accidental deaths on a date.
Int,"An alternative assumption is that instead of record labels viewing their content solely as Music, they may categorize their channels as Entertainment."
Int,"Thus, since effects were not assigned randomly, Preston Jorgensen can only conclude associative effects."
Res,"Again, our three highest view count categories contain outliers with very large numbers that skewed our mean values to a higher number."
Other,Figure 2 only supports that.
RQDef,"In this study, we used a poisson GAM with lagged predictors to examine the relationship between mortality and pollutants."
Other,"In other words, $log(a)>log(b)$ would imply that $a > b$."
MethJust,"After running the cross validation, we get the mean square errors: 200.4028 without lagged variables and 186.8249 with lagged variables."
Data,"It is integrated and presented by Cortez and Morais (2007), with the first database being collected by the inspector of Montesinho fire occurrences and the second database being collected by the Braganca Polytechnic Institute."
Lim,"Thus the averaging may potentially hide a stronger effect that is truly there, but is not fully manifested because of the animals in different clusters being mixed together."
Res,"Because our p-value is less than our 0.05 threshold, we can reject our null hypothesis of all the means being equal."
Lim,"In the future, we can perform experimental research by picking out groups of people to do and not to drugs for a set period of time and tracking the difference in their physical well-being before and after the experiment."
Data,"In order to answer these questions, we will use a dataset with 5,114 observations (2)"
Int,"However, we are not confident to say this is definitely the case."
Int,"Furthermore, we can interpret this to mean that the temperature is a better indicator of the number of deaths."
Data,Relevant features are included below: 'Maximum.longevity.yrs' : Represents the maximum longevity (lifespan) in years.
Lim,Maximum lifespan is more easily influenced by outliers and is less representative of the life expectancy of the population (3).
Lim,It would have been helpful to have more cities in this analysis to feel that it was more thorough.
Res,The number of subscribers has a standard deviation close to the mean of around 3556605 subscribers.
Struct,"Using this data, we will answer the following three questions."
Context,"Health insurance serves as the primary source of coverage for most Americans with the benefits of financial protection from unexpected, expensive medical costs."
MethDef,"Thus, we will apply log-transformation on $death$, and we will refer to the transformed variable as $death.log$ (2)"
Int,"This is different than our previous interval, possibly because we re-sampled the cases (indicating nonparametric bootstrapping and that we could not conclude our error was uniformly distributed) are are testing many more samples, whereas before we had simply assumed our set model was the correct one."
Res,"(3) According to Table 2, the cross validation error for model 1 is 200.3191 and the cross validation error for model 2 is 186.6846"
Int,"Thus, I can not draw causation between metabolic rate and lifespan because there might be unmeasured counfouding variables outside the dataset."
MethDef,"For the spline model, s() denotes a non-linear smoothing function with df number of degrees of freedom."
Data,"(2) As we can see from Figure 1 above, the response variable 'Maximum.longevity.yrs', is very right skewed with a few large outliers, therefore I decide to log-transform it to improve the normality."
MethJust,"Further, if interpretability and simplicity are prioritized, we could pick Model 1 instead of Model 5 as our final model."
Int,This model helped us understand that the pollutant ozone has the strongest association with deaths.
Data,"$Chicago$ has 5,114 observations on air quality, temperature, and the number of non-accidental death in Chicago each day from January 1987 to the end of December 2000"
MethDef,"As such, we performed an exponential transformation on the metabolic rate per unit body mass and the lifespan variables to try to better ascertain any underlying relationships."
Data,The AnAge Database of Animal Aging and Longevity contains a vareity of continuous variables along with several identifying variables.
Int,"First, we use an ANOVA test to conclude that there is sufficient evidence for a relationship between age and drug usage."
RQDef,"Using the smoothing spline model with 6 degrees of freedom, we examined the relationship between lifespan and metabolic rate to determine whether lower metabolic rates resulted in longer lifespans."
RQDef,"Since different diagnoses are associated with different diseases and therefore different states of the patient’s body, it is reasonable to assume that certain diseases lead to higher rates of MDRB infection."
RQJust,More posts on a thread may be related to more content and interesting material to read through.
Data,The first one is the response variable $Max.lifespan$.
MethJust,"Furthermore, even if the residuals can be interpreted as homoskedastic, the resampling cases method would remain valid which makes it a statistically appropriate method either way (6)."
Data,Only a few shoot past and match the longest livespans of humankind.
RQDef,To gather evidence to suggest which polluntants appear to be most associated with mortality we plotted the partial response functions showing the average relationship between each variable and the outcome (Figure 13)
Int,"All this considered, it is safe to say that low subscribers are more likely to lead to low viewsPerVideo (based on the data)."
MethJust,"Checking the pairs plot below in figure 5, we can see that there is no variable with significantly high correlation that may lead to multicollinearity issue."
MethJust,We also see a distinct left skew in the temperature distribution along with the fact that all 3 of the variables had potential outliers.
Int,"(2) We concluded that the true relationship is negative and linear, meaning that as the metabolic rate of a species decreases, the lifespan of the species appears to increase in a linear fashion."
Data,"'o3median' appears to be right skewed, with a peak at around 0 parts per billion."
Int,"In other words, the level of pollutants would affect the death rate over time instead of immediately."
Struct,There are limitations to this analysis beyond the lack of causation.
Res,This means the the music video’s viewsPerVideo have a large spread.
Int,"However, it is important to note that this study is observational, as variables such as stool sample diversity, liver disease severity, and diagnosis of liver disease cannot be assigned randomly."
MethDef,"After experimenting with a number of transformations to the data, we discovered that a log transformation provided us with a much more normal looking histogram (Figure 1 right)."
RQJust,"Since it is likely that different positions of players cause the players to have different roles on the field, i.e some positions pass the ball more than others, it seems relatively sensible to hypothesize that there will be different mean total passes based on the position a player plays."
Int,This could be one of the reasons why the two people in my high school have different numbers of subscribers: the one with more subscribers created his account 2 years earlier than the one with less subscribers.
MethJust,"In the previous pair plots, we see distinct clustering in the bottom left corner of the scatterplot with no noticable linear patterns."
Res,"For every one unit increase in log metabolic rate, there is 0.51269 decrease in log lifespan."
Context,"Knowing this extra information plus our analysis can help creators who want to get paid for uploading videos see how all these variables tie together and help guide their YouTube career- whether this be choosing a category to influence their content, show how there are no relationships between category and subscribers as well as category and views which can help if they don’t think their chosen/favorite category is not as popular as others."
Data,"Moving forward, we will now only use data with the heat wave of 1995 outliers removed."
Int,"(2) Therefore, we can say there is significant evidence that adding the averages of the pollutants improves the regression."
MethDef,"In order to determine the most accurate regression model for the data, we begin by constructing two Poisson generalized additive models to the data with spline smoothing terms having 4 degrees of freedom for all predictor models, and the first model uses the regular median pollution predictors and temperature, the second model uses the average median predictors for pollution and temperature (1)"
Res,This distribution is clearly right-skewed with a relatively short right tail and has large outliers at 746.28 and 1090.84.
RQJust,"Since YouTube is based in North America and much of its content seems to be created there, we hypothesize that North America has the greatest amount of YouTube users."
Data,"The median income of OkCupid users is $50,000 with a standard deviation of $195,775."
Struct,Figure 5 demonstrates this postive relationships.
Context,Viewers can get a better grasp of how the algorithm works and which videos tend to do better on the platform.
Int,This suggests that the lagged air pollutants may very well be associated with mortality and that our model fits the data better when we include these pollutant features in our poisson GAM (2)
Struct,"Now since we have two models, we want to assess which model is a better fit to the data."
MethJust,1 We don't consider Model 1.2 as a candidate for the model selection process because the rubric explicitly asks us to use binary regression.
Struct,We decided to start by creating at the plot of the residuals.
Int,That lack of linearity and the extremely low correlation coefficient shows the number of subscribers has very little correlation to the views per video.
MethJust,This suggests that the residuals are normally distributed.
MethJust,"As we see from the table, spline model with degrees of freedom being 7 is the best model out of all the models with its MSE error being 0.3573843, which is the lowest MSE error out of all models we observe (3)."
Int,One possibility for why the outliers appear to all have low RH values while the correlation is very weak could be because RH's graph is right-skewed with a long right tail.
Context,Do we recommend that Preston Jorgensen finance such a decrease in pollution.
Res,"By using 1000 bootstrap iterations, the confidence interval is between 99.75592 and 113.31885"
Data,"From the distribution, it can be seen that there are many players above the average playing time of 208.864 minutes."
MethDef,"Similar to Model 1, we also build a GAM, called Model 2, to predict $death.log$ from all lagged variables, which are $time$, $lag_pm10$, $lag_ozone$, $lag_so2$, and $lag_tmpd$ (1)"
Lim,Our model is not without limitations.
MethJust,We made this distinction so that when we compare which model better fits the data we would be able to analogously answer one of Jorgansen's question and see whether the effects of pollutants on mortality are immediate (model 1) or if they extend over time (model 2)
Lim,"It would also be interesting to see if the time period in which channels are active (early 2000s, late 2000s, early 2010s, beyond) has any relationship to success as well."
Lim,"For further research, the study should try to include more potential confounding variables in the model."
RQDef,"In this project, I focus on whether or not the number of subscribers is affected by viewsPerVideo, accountAge, or videoUploads."
RQDef,We hypothesize that status could indicate a user’s height or equivalently that there is a relationship between status and height.
Res,"Ultimately we found there to be no consistency among the subscriber counts of account categories and that the country with the largest median subscriber count was the Republic of Korea, not the United States."
Data,"Throughout this report, we will primarily focus on the quantitative components of the Fire Weather Index which is comprised of the Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC), Duff Moisture Code (DMC), Drought Code (DC) and Initial Spread Index (ISI)."
Data,"The association between 'temperature' and 'death' seems to be the strongest, with the association between 'death' and $O_3$ being the strongest pollutant-mortality association."
Struct,We will now begin univariate data analysis on the most relevant and interesting continuous variables.
Context,"Increased drought, and a longer fire season are boosting these increases in wildfire risk (c2es.org)."
RQDef,"Finally, we will answer Jorgensen's question of whether reducing the pollution by a certain amount would reduce his chance of death, by giving a prediction of death rate with lowest values of pollution."
MethJust,The difference between the models is not significant as the models have similar standard errors.
Res,"We also see that News and Politics hold the second-lowest ranking, the lowest being sports."
Res,"With these levels of pollutants, my model will predict the mean number of deaths on a 70-degree day to be 110.3491"
Data,"As established in the data section, there are four positions: Defender, Forward, Goalkeeper, and Midfielder."
Struct,There are some limitations to address in this research.
RQDef,The first question in this report focuses on characterizing the month of forest fire occurrence.
Data,"According to this table, a majority of accounts, 595 to be exact, are located within the United States."
MethJust,We decided to do one model with the non-lagged predictors and one model with the lagged predictors to determine if the lagged or non-lagged variables were better suited for modeling the data.
MethDef,"As we stated above, we will set Maximum Longevity as our response variable while we set Metabolic rate by mass as our predictor variable."
MethJust,"As seen in the scatterplot above, we can analyze relationships or trends between death and every corresponding predictor variable, and these scatterplots reveal a lot of vertical clustering for death vs. predictor variables."
RQDef,"Furthermore, we will see if the effect of pollution is instantaneous or extends over time."
Data,"To answer these questions, we will be using data with the measurements of air quality in Chicago, Illinois beginning in January 1987 to December 2000"
Context,"One such risk is infection by multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB), as the antibiotics that are taken after the transplant increases the risk of such infections."
Data,"We have collected data from 1259 youtube accounts ranging from 25 to 692 weeks of age, as well as data from 9 categories and 19 countries."
Res,The interquartile of subscribers have a 25th percentile of 1080841 and the 75th percentile of 3880515.
Context,"The ozone layer high in the stratosphere absorbs most ultraviolet light from the Sun, but ozone at ground level is dangerous."
Lim,"Additionally, we chose the bootstrapping method that relied on the fewest number of assumptions about the model."
Data,'Body.mass.g' represents the typical adult body mass and its unit is in Watts.
Res,The line of best fit has an intercept of 254.99 and a coefficient of 2.64.
Data,"However, form the data we see that the maximum lifespan is actually 19."
Data,"Another variable of interest is category, which describes the genre of the uploaded video and its overall channel."
Struct,Our null and alternative hypotheses are as follows.
Int,We have also found that relative humidity does not appear to have a significant linear relationship with the total area burned and as such we do not recommend using it as a tool to predict fire severity.
Int,Our analysis led us to the conclusion that the decrease in metabolic rate leads to increase in lifespan.
MethDef,"While we have the variable temperature that can help explain this situation, we believe these observations should be removed anyway."
Lim,"Although this event is partially explained by high temperature and ozone levels, our data does not contain information regarding humidity levels which plays a significant role to the 1995 Heat Wave's deadly nature."
Data,The reason we are exploring the univariate distribution of original data is lag variables are average of these varaibles.
RQDef,Next we will predict and produce a 95% confidence interval for the mean number of non-accidental deaths on a 70 degree day with the smallest levels of pollutants.
Data,"Looking closer, we see that ozone is associated with temperature, and past about 55 degrees fahrenheit, ozone consistently increases."
Data,"The defender, midfielder, and forward positions had similar spreads, but defenders had a higher median."
Int,This suggests that these outliers may be related to high temperatures and/or high ozone concentration.
MethDef,"(1) To move step forward from the linear regression, we also want to see if a smoothing spline of 'log.maximum.longevity.yrs' on 'log.metabolic.by.mass', which is also a linear smoother, can fit the data better with different effective degrees of freedom."
Res,We can see from the scatterplot below plotting account age vs number of subscribers that there is a positive relationship and positive linear fit.
RQDef,"By understanding the playing time of players, we can get a better idea of how playing time is distributed amongst the team as well as how it can affect the match."
Context,"So, for example, through the data, you could take away that events and trends that are going on in these countries will possibly show up a lot in the search engine and therefore might lead to more views and subscribers for those who can capitalize on the opportunity."
MethJust,"Although these are clear outliers, I am going to keep them in the data because these deaths are a result of the environment and not a random freak event."
Res,"Since our p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis."
Data,"Therefore, we will look at 'log(death)' instead of 'death' in this univariate analysis."
Int,"Thus, it seems that pollutants do contribute to mortality."
MethDef,"After the exploratory data analysis, I decide to use transformations on both lifespan and metabolic by mass."
Struct,"Furthermore, I researched on whether there is a relationship between explanatory variables."
MethJust,"As we see from figure 4 in the last section, the residuals do not follow the normal distribution, which means we cannot use parametric bootstrap."
MethJust,Based on the normality plot it seems like our normality assumption is fine.
Context,"Billionaire Preston Jorgensen would like to understand factors related to lifespan, and invest in research projects which use these factors to achieve immortality."
MethDef,"Therefore, it seems that our residuals are normally distributed which leads us to use parametric bootstrapping method to compare 95% confidence interval."
RQDef,"And finally, we analyzed the correlation between DMC and DC."
Context,Doctors and epidemiologists belive that air pollution is an important factor contributing to death rate in Chicago.
MethDef,"Thus, our linear model is the following: log(Maximum.longevity.yrs) = 0.1492 + -0.39993log(Metabolic.by.mass)."
Lim,"Second, the chosen linear regression model violates the assumption of homoscedasticity, which may affect the validity of confidence interval that is tested based on the assumptions of linear models."
Data,"As we are interested in the relationship between metabolic rate and longevity, our major explanatory variable will be $Metabolic.by.mass$, which measures the amount of energy (in Watts) used per gram of body mass."
MethDef,"We can create a scatterplot with categories and subscribers: as illustrated in figure 3, below."
MethDef,(1)We conducted global chi-goodness-of-fit test on model2 to assess how well the model fits.
RQDef,Our second hypothesis will involve a possible association between the quantitative variable age and the quantitative variable income.
RQDef,Our second research question is to see if their is a relationship between categories and subscribers and characterize if there is one present.
Data,There are also four additional variables that measure the 7-day averages of the temperature and three pollutant variables.
Int,"This is also verified by the qq-plot of Model A's residuals, as the tail of the points deviates from the black line a lot."
RQDef,Are there specific characteristics of animals that make them able to live longer?
Struct,"Figure 5 demonstrates the error for different models, where the linear model corresponds to an effective degrees of freedom of 2."
Res,The pollutant that was most strongly associated with increased deaths was ozone concentration.
Int,"The estimated slope, -411.58, suggests that for every year older a person is, they make around $411.58 less on average."
Lim,We could also compare the number of attempted shots to the number of successful shots to see if the players that attempted the most were actually the most useful to the team.
Res,"To further summarize the data with table 3, we observe that June has 17 counts, which comprise only about 3.3% of the sample size."
MethJust,"By looking at the summary of the model we see that the $r^2$ value is 0.4311, which isn't very ideal, indicating there might be better models to describe the relationship."
Res,"We explore this relationship and find that pollutants do have an association with the deaths, and ozone has theh strongest association."
RQDef,"In this project, we will explore how sex is related to high income, education level, and drinking preferences."
Lim,"All the lag variables have missing datapoints, which wehave already discussed the issues with."
Data,The spread for ozone is quite ams.
Int,"From the regression equation, we note that the estimated slope is .009389, which means that for each additional minute of play time, we estimate a .009389 increase in the number of shots attempted."
Data,The sulfur dioxide variable is the median contribution of sulfur dioxide.
MethJust,"However, it is good to note that the difference between the two errors is very small."
RQDef,"In this study, we used a smoothing spline to examine the relationship between the metabolic rate of animals and their lifespan."
Res,"Since the p-value is not less than alpha significance levels 0.05 or 0.01, we do not reject the Null hypothesis."
RQDef,"Further exploring these relationships, we calculated the mean number of non accidental deaths if the covariates were at their historical lows, except for lag_temperature, which we set to 70 degrees Fahrenheit."
MethDef,"Note, we must first calculate the confidence intervals in the link-scaled form and then exponential-scale back the data to the response scale since our model outputs the predicted death rate as log-scaled."
Int,There was a heat wave during this time that killed over 700 people over these 4 days.
Data,The relationship between them seems weak and is likely due to the effect of outliers (6).
MethJust,"Because using the 'predict' function relies on such a key assumption that we can't guarantee is held, we will create a pivotal confidence interval with a bootstrap, which typically has less strict assumptions."
Data,There are four days on which the death rate exceeds 200 F (1995/07/13 - 1995/07/16)
Int,"However, this does not imply that the they cause high mortality."
MethDef,We can carry out the test at the level of 0.01.
Data,"The sample size consists of 1,500 individuals who were active on 06/30/2012 and had active accounts on 06/26/2012."
MethJust,"On the other hand the scatterplot for maximum.longevity.yrs and metabolic.by.mass, is notably improved with the log transformed data."
Context,This is so that reserach can be effectively funded to figure out how to influence these factors to extend lifespan.
Data,"Temperature, on the other hand, shows slightly left skewed distribution(1) with mean 114.984 fahernheit."
Struct,"Figure 3 below shows all the relationships between our original potential predictors which are measured daily, as well as our our response, log-death."
MethJust,"Additionally, although the residuals do appear pretty normal, the deviation seen from the plots mildly concerns us and it's safer to assume that the residuals do not follow a given distribution, which this method of bootstrapping also allows us to do (6)."
Res,"(3) Moreover, if each pollutant is lowered to its lowest recorded value, the estimated mean death rate in Chicago on a 70-degree day would be 106.1945 with a 95% confidence interval between 99.75592 and 113.31885"
Context,"These relationships examined can inform Youtubers who make a career on this platform, in the way that they can take comfort in the fact that number of videos uploaded does not have a relationship to account success."
Res,"The confidence interval is (6.005374, 33.61207) years."
Int,"Because our p-value is less than the significance level of alpha=0.05, then we have sufficient evidence to reject the null, that the true mean age is 30 years old, and that we have evidence for the alternative hypothesis, that the true mean age for the user is greater than 30 years old."
MethDef,Our null and alternate hypotheses are as follows.
RQDef,But what specifically renders the platform so popular?
Context,In fact in July 1995 there was a scorch of three days which resulted in killing 739 people dead.
Res,Our model indicated that there exists a negative and nonlinear relationship between lifespan and metabolic rate.
RQDef,Our third research question is to review whether there is a relationship between category and subscribers and identify the relationship if there is one.
Int,"In context, we have sufficient evidence to conclude that the true mean playing time is not greater than 200 minutes."
Context,"With the growing effects of climate change, natural disasters will increase in frequency and severity in the coming years."
MethDef,We carry out the test at level 0.05.
MethDef,We can formally test our research question of whether drug avoidance indicates at or above median income with an ANOVA test.
RQJust,We observe that data was obtained within 30 minutes of the fire starting.
MethDef,We calculated a 95% pivotal confidence interval for the mean lifespan using 1000 bootstrap iterations.
Struct,"Now, let's talk about the summary of these key variables."
Data,"Category is a categorical variable indicating which genre of videos the Youtube account posts (i.e., gaming, entertainment)."
Res,"Using our lagged GAM, the 95% confidence interval for the mean number of deaths given these pollution levels on a 70-degree day is: [105.69, 112.44] deaths, or approximately between 106 and 112 deaths."
MethDef,"We expect that almost all of the data should fall within the plotted bounds, and if it does not, we suspect the observation is an outlier."
MethDef,"We will use more sophisticated and flexible model, smoothing spline to observe the trend and relationship further."
RQDef,We will try to answer the following research question: Are the levels of these air pollutants associated with mortality after controlling for time and temperature.
Context,"For reference, a crab-eating raccoon with a normal metabolic rate has a lifespan of 19 years."
MethJust,"Compared to Model 5, Model 1.2 controls for more potential confounding variables and are more reliable for casual inference."
Data,"In Figure 2, we do not see an very obvious relations besides the variables with their lag counterpart, which we would expect."
Struct,Now we’ll create a formal hypothesis.
Data,We can see that we have data from the end of 1986 to the end of 2000
Int,The concave up curvature of the lag-ozone term plot does not resemble the relationship seen by our lag-temperature term plot.
MethDef,"To test this, we will construct a model using only temperature as a predictor."
Data,"Our study specifically analyzed income, relationship status, and age with our main variable: drug usage."
Data,"Tmpd has a minimum of -16, maximum of 92, median of 51, mean of 50.1933, and standard deviation of 19.462"
Lim,This would allow us to take into account the fact that some people are getting more viewsPerVideo because more people are joining Youtube during their prime.
MethDef,"First, let's do a goodness-of-fit test."
Data,The categorical variable month indicates the month of the year that the forest fire happened.
Res,"(3) The pivotal 95% resampling of residuals bootstrap method confidence interval with 1000 iterations gives us an interval of (19.24863,41.35943)."
Int,"Since our confidence interval calculated includes 19, we are unable to conclude that halving the metabolic rate for this animal will definitely result in an increase in lifespan."
RQDef,Our next research question is to investigate whether the age of a thread in SFN is associated with the view count.
Lim,"This analysis does not look at any pollutants beside ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter."
Int,"However, we were only able to find a positive correlation between drinking and body type and doing drugs and body type."
Lim,"Second, we are constrained by our computing power."
MethDef,Our hypotheses are.
Data,They also visualize that all three pollutant vairables are roughly centered about zero (keeping in mind that they were shifted and zero does not represent their true mean)
Res,"The resulting p-value is less than $2.2times 10^{-16}$, which is close to 0 and suggests that Model 2 fits significantly better than the null model (1)"
MethJust,We considered factoring in the taxonomic classification of the animals to see whether the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan differed between species.
Res,"If each pollutant is reduced to its lowest recorded value, we estimated that the mean number of deaths on a 70-degree day would be 106.1945 with a 95% confidence interval between 99.75592 and 113.31885"
Res,"Our model predicts that if air pollution is at such a minimum level, and the average temperature is 70 degrees in the past 7 days, the expected $death.log$ in Chicago on 30 December 2000 is 4.675179 (5)"
Res,"The median number of views per video we also found was 1,030,668, much lower than that of the mean that was recorded."
Data,We can see that the outliers of high numbers of deaths during the summer of 1995 are now gone while the seasonal pattern persists.
MethJust,From the p-value test we see that both variable are significant.
Data,"O3median has a minimum of -24.779, maximum of 43.688, median of -3.326, mean of -2.1794, and standard deviation of 10.2036"
MethDef,"Now, we will perform parametric bootstrapping because, apart from a handful of outliers, the residuals appear to be normal and centered around 0, in the plots in Figure 8"
MethDef,"Because Model 2 had a lower prediction error than Model 1, we will use Model 2 for later analysis."
Int,"Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no association between sex and drug habits, and conclude that there is not sufficient evidence for a relationship between sex and drug habits."
Data,"The data being used comes from the AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity, providing information compiled from hundreds of scientific papers for thousands of species."
MethDef,"Next, we will analyze the playtime of players by position graphically with side by side box plots, seen in the box plots below."
Int,"Thus, I can not conclude that an animal with 50% slower metabolic rate has a different lifespan than the original."
RQDef,"The second question to look at is if the effect of pollution is instantaneous or extends over time: in other words, does the amount of pollution on a certain day affect only the death rate of that day or does pollution affect the death rate over the next few days."
RQJust,"We observe that people deviating from physical wellness have far fewer people identifying with “never” using drugs, e.g., “overweight” with 20 and “a little extra” with 71."
Res,The distribution is right skewed with several extremely high RH values reaching up to 100%.
Context,It offered people the ability to share videos and upload them to a single site for nearly anyone in the world with internet access to see.
Data,"As for our temperature variable, we see a bimodal distribution in both our original and lag variables with peaks, from largest to second largest, respectively, around 69 and 37 degrees fahrenheit."
Data,The data referenced in this project was collected on 06/30/2012.
Int,Another could be that the believed effects of greater humidity on the severity of fires are negligible.
Data,"As briefly mentioned above, our Chicago dataset consists of 5,114 observations with 6 variables."
MethJust,These outliers can be kept as it is explained by tempreature(3)
Data,The particulate matter variable is the median density of particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers.
Data,The mean play time is 208.864 minutes per player and the standard deviation is 145.434 minutes.
MethJust,"The MSE of model B is slightly lower, but the decrease amount is smaller than the estimation's standard error."
Res,"From the table above, we can see that the category with the biggest mean of views is Music, not Entertainment."
RQDef,"Because different articles often fall into different channels, as shown in Figure 1, we predict that the number of shares each article gets will depend on the channel that article falls into."
Res,A one-sample proportion test of the drug use being “never” returns a p-value of 0 and a 95% confidence interval of 0.6154 to 0.666.
Struct,"In order to test whether there is a relationship between drug usage habits and age, we have to justify the use of an ANOVA test."
Int,We were able to conclude with relative confidence that the number of deaths on any given day in Chicago is most associated with pollution over short time periods (1 week) as opposed to pollutant measurements on any particular day.
Int,"Before we delve into the findings, we must preface that all of our findings are purely associative and not causal because are models are based off of observational data."
Data,"Out of all physically well people, 66% classify as non drug users."
RQJust,"Based on the distribution of the number of articles published by the date of publication shown in Figure 2, we hypothesize that articles released on Wednesday will have more words in the title."
Struct,Below is the corresponding regression equation and the correlation coefficient.
Lim,"Our analysis does have limitations, such as the fact that certain YouTube channels were excluded due to the fact of their popularity and such high extreme numbers ( ex: PewDiePie, gaming channel with second highest number of subscribers)."
Struct,There are 3 main ressearch questions we address in this report.
Data,"Lag_tmpd has a minimum of -5.714, maximum of 85.429, median of 51, mean of 50.2224, and standard deviation of 18.4023"
Lim,Our inference may be lacking in that it was not specific enough about when the wealth/income was obtained versus when drugs were actually in use.
RQDef,The first scenarios would analyze the distribution of total damages paid to plaintiffs.
Int,This is perhaps because of the high number of mammals in our dataset.
Struct,We realized that our study has many limitations.
Data,"Looking at the distribution graph below in figure 3, it is clear that it is right-skewed meaning the mean is greater than the median (shown in figure 4)."
MethDef,"To better understand the relationships between these means, we graphically investigate the relationship between drugs and age on a box plot."
Data,"The distribution of Playtime is relatively unimodal, with the primary mode being around 0 to 100 minutes."
Context,"It seems fairly common in our world to drink alcohol, smoke, or use drugs."
MethDef,Ha: There is an association between sex and smoking habits (sex and smoking habits are dependent).
Res,"According to the boxplot, it also suggests that plaintiffs that claim fraud-related cases received more damages in remedy as indicated by the higher median on the box plot."
Struct,Below is a table with the results of our cross-validation.
Struct,"From the plots for our chosen additive model shown above, we look at the average relationship between each variable and the outcome, with uncertainty."
Res,"From prior analysis, we conclude that animals with lower metabolic rates have higher lifespans, on average (1)."
MethDef,"With that said, we will continue to use the smooth spline model with 6 degrees of freedom as our selected model freedom since it produces the lowest prediction error (5)."
Int,The model was based on association between these variables and the dataset we used was observational.
Data,"Other variables we will investigate in relation to status are age, height, and sex."
MethJust,"To use the ANOVA test, we need large sample sizes, and based on Figure 1, we know that all of our values are greater than 30, so we can apply a Normal approximation for inference."
Lim,"Random sampling is a much better way to collect a sample than voluntary sampling, and will thus garner better results."
Res,The relationship between metabolic rate and maximum lifespan is not linear (1).
Data,"Additionally, most of the animals in our dataset have a Metabolic rate by mass that is lower than 0.01."
Int,"The difference between the two models' prediction errors appeared to be significant given that the difference was greater than the uncertainty in your estimates of the prediction error (i.e., standard error)"
Other,"Second, the categories must be independent."
Struct,"We begin our exploration by analyzing the univariate distributions of each of the predictor variables, as well as the response variable ('Maximum.longevity.yrs')."
MethJust,"In Figure 5, we examine that the plot is hard to be interpreted due to excessive amount of points clustered in the corner of the graph."
Context,"Many species are dying out because of these toxic conditions, and thus many scientists theorize that there may also be a relationship between this increase in toxicity and a possible increase in mortality in humans."
Data,The key variables that will answer Jorgensen's questions are Lifespan and Metabolic.by.mass.
Data,"When looking at Figure 1 from the Data section, it can be seen that there is a lot of variance in playtime."
RQDef,This report will examine age as a demographic on OkCupid profiles and analyze the relationship between age and other variables like income and drug usage.
Res,Entertainment’s outliers only range from around 5 million to 31 million.
Context,"In order to gain a better idea of how playing time is distributed during matches so that players can get time on the field, the 2010 World Cup will be evaluated."
MethDef,(3) We then performed a bootstrap to make a 95% confidence interval with 1000 bootstrap iterations.
Data,"Since we want to see how Maximum Longevity changes depending on different values of Metabolic Rate, we notify that Maximum Longevity to be our response variable."
Res,"The value increased the lifespan of crab-eating raccoon by 2.34173 years, which indicates a significant change."
MethDef,We can use a hypothesis test for different proportions.
Int,"(2) As we established the model using the 7-day averages of each pollutants and temperature to be a better fit as it has lower cross-validation error, we can say that it is likely the effect of pollution appears to extend over time."
MethDef,The model is as follows: log(Maximum.longevity.yrs) = B0 + B1log(Metabolic.by.mass) (1).
Res,"The category with the lowest correlation coefficient is Music with 0.223, while the category with the highest correlation coefficient is News and Politics with 0.466."
Res,"Additionally, the music category has significantly more outliers than the entertainment category."
MethJust,"The standard error for the linear model was approximately .0157 and the standard error for the spline models was approximately .0165-.0172, we will discuss the relevant of these standard error values later in the report."
Int,"Another explanation could be that due to geographical reasons, the seasons in the sample group (Montesinho natural park) occur later, meaning the park experiences the greatest risk factors later in the year."
Int,"The confidence interval created was [0.005061, 5.062], which does not include the calculated value and as such we conclude that at 95% confidence, the longevity of the crab-eating raccoon calculated is not the true value as it does not fall within the interval."
Struct,"To understand the variables, we will observe the box-plot shown below measuring the views given forum."
Res,"(4) Using the smallest values of pollutants for each 7-day average (-18.92390 ppb for the average median ozone concentration, -4.643285 ppb for the average median sulfur dioxide concentration, and -12.42099207 milligrams per cubic meter for the average median density of $PM_{10}$ pollution) and 70 degrees Fahrenheit for the temperature, we predict the death rate to be approximately 109 people dying that day under those conditions."
Lim,"More specifically, we give less weight to observations with larger variance as they provide less information."
Int,This suggests that it would be advisable to drink and do drugs in order to reach the goal of having a fit body.
RQDef,"With this data, we will be developing complex models analyzing the association between deaths and various pollutants."
Data,"Each observation includes variables such as kindom, common name, lifespan, body mass, metabolic rate, and body temperature."
Res,"In the ""Modeling"" section, we noted that the lagged GAM had a lower prediction error and standard error than the non-lagged GAM after running 5-fold cross-validation"
Data,"Similar to the first variable we examined, Maximum Longevity also is right skewed as we see the histogram in Figure 2, we observe that there are few outliers as well to the right side of the graph."
Data,Crab-eating raccoon is an animal whose metabolic rate is 2.588 Watts and whose typical body mass is 1160 grams (2).
MethDef,"(3) To determine which of the models fits best to the data in terms of prediction error, I use k fold cross-validation with k = 5."
RQDef,"To determine whether the pollutants are associated with mortality, we fitted a new model that use only 'lag_tmpd.diff' not the pollutants."
Context,"Although a videos goal is to get a lot of views, an accounts goal is to accumulate a lot of subscribers."
Int,"We cannot conclude that reducing the crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% would cause its lifespan to change as the value calculated did not fall within our 95% confidence interval, indicating we cannot reject the null that changing the raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% would not change the lifespan of the raccoon."
Data,The dataset contains 5114 observations of 10 variables.
MethJust,"From the residuals plot, we see that they seem randomly distributed around the 0 line."
MethDef,"Now that all the models have been fit, we are going to do 5 fold cross validation to figure out what the prediction error and standard error for each respective model is, so that we can quantify which model is most predicitive (and thus better) with independent, new data sets."
Context,"Moreover, we believe there to be many factors that may determine which accounts receive more subscribers."
MethJust,The standard deviation I get for the linear model is 0.03337748.
Lim,We don’t know whether other previous forest fires have data that could drastically disprove our hypotheses or conclusions.
Data,"Therefore, their distribution appears very similar although figures not shown."
Data,"(1) Since our task is to find if slowing the metabolic rate may increase lifespan, the response variable 'Maximum.longevity.yrs', Maximum longevity (lifespan), in years, and the feature 'Metabolic.by.mass', in Watts per gram, are key variables that we are interested."
MethDef,"Although we are using log of death as our response in our modeling, we belive that including the non-transformed time series can provide valuable and relevant insight to understanding the data."
RQDef,The research goal is to explore the relationship between lifespan and metabolic rate.
Other,"First, we must be using contingency table data."
Data,It has a median of 3.023e-03 watt/gram and a mean of 4.405e-03 watt/gram.
Res,"Second, after transformation, the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan appears to be moderately linear."
Res,"Lastly, we used our model to find that the mean lifespan of an animal with the crab-eating raccoon’s characteristics but a 50% smaller metabolic rate is 20.12 years, with a pivotal confidence interval of [18.20, 22.21]."
Data,"To continue, the distribution of PlayingTime appears to be bimodal (modes at 0-49 and 250-299 minutes), right-skewed, and contains a few possible outliers at 350-399 and 500-549 minutes."
Struct,Our null and alternative hypotheses are as follows.
MethJust,"Looking at the univariate eda above, we can see that our response variable, maximum.longevity.yrs, is strongly right skewed and our metabolic.by.mass predictor variable is also strongly right skewed."
Data,"We analyzed statistics from 1,259 YouTube channels up until the end of 2018."
Res,The uncertainty for 'lag_o3median' also appears to be less wide than the other two pollutant variables.
Res,"Our estimate for the expected number of deaths from our bootstrap is 114.52 (4.74 on the log-scale) or about 114 people, and has a 95% pivotal confidence interval of (114.08, 114.99), (4.737, 4.745) on the log-scale, or about (114, 115) people."
MethDef,We can visually compare the diversity distribution for the two groups of SampleMDRB using a boxplot in Figure 6.
Data,"To formalize this hypothesis, we will be focusing on the average title length and the different channels each article falls into."
MethDef,"We're including the lag variables in our analysis to explore the possibility of deaths being related to the amount of pollution over several days, rather than a single day alone."
Res,"We can see that the average outcome of our spline terms are generally nonlinearly related to the data except for lag-temperature, which appears to be roughly linear with a negative relationship."
RQDef,"Therefore, throughout this research paper, we are going to investigate if there is a relationship between air pollutatant and death rate in the given data, Chicago."
Lim,"Future analyses might include genetics, such as if subscribers are prone to a certain health condition, accidents or unexpected injuries, and if there had serious health issues prior to the claim period."
Data,"In our investigation, we will focus on the status variable, which is a categorical variable categorizing the relationship status of the user into: single, seeing someone, married, or available (in an open relationship)."
MethJust,"Thus, it seems like there is a significant difference between the linear and spline model, but not between the individual spline models themselves (5)."
Data,"(2) The crab-eating raccoon has a lifespan of 19 years, a bodyweight of 1160 grams and a metobalic rate of 2.588 watts."
Struct,"Finally, we believe that there is great future for this study."
RQJust,We chose Music as the most frequent because we assume that many artists/record companies create channels in order to gain exposure and release music videos for fans.
MethJust,"Model one, with the non-lag variables, has an cross-validation error of 200.9856 and an estimated standard of error of 22.1774"
MethDef,"After trying a simple linear regression, we want to try using a smoothing spline."
Struct,This is a histogram showing the count of people in the dataset based on how often they classify their drug usage.
Data,This is a quantitative variable that measures the number of shots attempted per player.
MethDef,"To find the relationship, we can first start by visually examining our data through a box plot."
Data,"These variables are represented as 03median, so2median, pm10median, tmpdmedian in dataset."
Data,"Notably, the often group has a size of n=20, while the other groups have a sample size of at least a couple hundred."
Context,"In American history, the gender gap in education was severe, with elite colleges not opening their doors to women until the early 1900’s."
Data,"The 'date' variable has an almost uniform distribution but a drop in observations at around 1989, with values randing from 1987 to 2000"
RQDef,"Second, is the effect of pollution on death instantaneous, or does it extend over time."
Data,(2) Metabolic by mass ranges from 4.543e-05 to 4.143e-02 watt/gram.
RQDef,"Lastly, we will consider if the level of each pollutant were lowered to match the lowest value ever recorded, what mean death rate would we estimate for Chicago on a 70-degree day, and if Mr. Jorgensen should spend his fortune to reduce pollution by that much (1)"
RQDef,"We have been hired by eccentric billionaire, Preston Jorgensen, to analyze the database to figure out what factors, if any, have a relationship with lifespan."
Int,"Under such assumptions, we claim that lower metabolic rates lead to higher maximum lifespans (1)."
Context,"Rather, from the comfort of their own home, people can meet and interact with possible partners and begin relationships."
Data,"For context, the Phylum Chordata contains 4216 entries, while the next-largest Phylum is Arthropoda, with 11 entries."
Res,Only 4 out of 9 categories have a median subscriber count within the range of 1.5 to 2 million.
Context,"Because so many people seek connection, a large amount of data can be collected from online dating profiles about the habits of a diverse population."
Data,"The position with the most amount players was Midfielder with 228 players, and the position with the least amount of players was Goalkeeper with 36 players."
MethDef,"Based on our analysis of the predictor and response variables, we chose to apply log transformations to both for the rest of the analysis."
MethJust,"From the table, we notice there is a pretty big drop off in going from a simple linear regression model to a smoothing spline in terms of MSE by roughly 0.01."
Data,"Our research questions additionally emphasize country and continent, both of which specify the general location of each subscriber."
RQDef,"Third, if each pollutant were lowered to be the lowest value ever recorded, what does the model predict for the mean death rate for Chicago on a 70-degree day."
RQDef,Our first hypothesis will will involve the mean age of the profiles.
Res,"Furthermore, relationship of the two variables without any transformation also shows the same pattern as we can see in Figure 10."
RQJust,"The ones with the most play time are also probably the most confident in their abilities, so they will attempt to score more goals as well."
Data,"Our data is from CDC measurements of different types of pollution and temperature in Chicago, IL"
Data,"As shown in figure 4, severity is unimodal and has a right skewed distribution."
RQDef,"Supported by Mr. Preston Jorgensen, we are allowed to analyze how air pollution and extreme temperature are associated with the mortality rate."
Data,"The goalkeeper position has a few low outliers, which may explain the low value."
Context,This study may also help YouTube as a company better understand its user base and its video streaming preferences.
Lim,So we hope future studies could find a more appropriate distribution of 'death' and design a better model.
Int,"Based on this, we are able to support our hypothesis as we can conclude that there are a few, large outliers that skews our data, pulling our mean to a larger value."
Data,"Data shows that 90.9% (1364/1500) users were single, 4.47% (67/1500) were seeing someone, 4.13% (62/1500) were available, 0.4% (6/1500) were married, and 0.0667% (1/1500) were unknown (as shown in Figure 1)."
Res,(1)Throughout the research we found that there is an association between pollutants mentioned and death rate.
Res,Music videos are more likely to garner views from 0 to 25 million than Entertainment because of the Music historgram's extended tail to the right.
MethJust,Each of these terms utilizes the same smoothing spline for each term with the same number of degrees of freedom.
Data,We have the information on 788 health insurance subscribers from the period of Janurary 1998 to December 1999.
Struct,"Whatever the case may be, we investigate the dependency of our variables of interest with time below."
Data,"Interestingly, we also find that there appears to be a slightly negative, linear correlation between temperature and number of deaths possibly due to the fact that death is more likely to occur during the winter when temperatures are very cold and weather is harsh."
RQDef,Our second hypothesis will involve a possible association between the quantitative variable age and the quantitative variable income.
MethDef,"Thus, we can use a parametric bootstrap to generate new data and construct our pivotal confidence interval."
Res,We found a very small p-value (0) which suggests that there is significant evidence to reject the lagged generalized additive model.
MethDef,Therefore going forward we will use 'Metabolic.by.mass' in place of either of those two variables.
Int,The observation given by the spline model makes more sense because we expect the new lifespan to be longer than the original lifespan of crab-eating raccoon.
MethJust,We would need to account for this relationship to control for its effect on the death rate when exploring the effect of pollutants.
Int,"This suggests that the uncertainty (i.e., standard error) from the bootstrap is larger than the estimate that relies on the usual linear model assumptions."
Res,(6) The bootstrapped confidence interval is wider than the confidence interval derived by simply predicting from the model without a bootstrap.
MethJust,"Our three options are: parametric bootstrap, resampling residuals, and resampling by cases."
Data,The mean view per video count was around 2960682.062 views per video.
Res,"However, keep in mind that MSE difference bewteen two models is rather small."
Context,"However, currently, women outnumber men at colleges and universities."
MethDef,"(2) To determine whether the pollutants are associated with mortality, we fit a model that uses only temperature as a feature and not the pollutants and conduct an ANOVA chi-squared test to see if there is a statistically significant difference between the two models."
Data,"Meaning that we see that as log(Metabolic.by.mass) increases, generally we see log(maximum.longevity.yrs) decrease."
Context,"(as detailed, for instance, in The Atlantic, Nov 27th, 2017, https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/11/gender-education-gap/546677/)."
Data,Figure 5 also shows strong correlations above 0.5 between $PM_{10}$ and $O_3$ and temperature.
Lim,"As long as more than 30 people answers “often”, then the ANOVA test can be applied accurately."
Res,"After the analyzing the data in several ways throughout this paper, we do not believe that it is clear that there is a relationship between atmospheric pollutants and mortality (1)"
Context,"After being forced to subscribe to them, I realized they have different amounts of subscribers: one has around one thousand subscribers whereas the other one has almost twenty thousands."
RQDef,"(ii) whether the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan, even after transformations, is linear."
RQDef,Is the relationship between lifespan and metabolic rate linear?
Context,"Here, we aim to find out if you should or should not drink if you want to be as fit as possible."
RQDef,"With the generous support or Mr Jorgenson, We will investigate the AnAge dataset, an aggregated dataset with information about a variety of animal species (mostly of the Chordata phylum) in order to determine whether we can clearly link some predictors to lifespan when it comes to animals."
MethJust,So the best spline model has a slighly lower mean squared error and a slightly higher standard error than the linear model.
Struct,"Next, we can examine how each variable relates to one another."
RQJust,Data points which represent the set thus must at least be significant enough to be considered a small to medium wildfire.
Struct,"Before formally testing the hypothesis, we will compare the differences in proportions between the categorizations within the smoking variable among males and females."
Int,"(3) Moreover, since our lag-model yielded better performance results and diagnostics over our per-day model as seen in the previous Modeling & Diagnostics section, we can conclude that deaths in Chicago are more associated with pollutants over time than instantaneously from measurements per day."
Res,"We got a 95 % confidence interval as (-0.4558601, -0.3440440)."
Res,The point estimate of the mean number of deaths on this day would be 109
Res,"In summary, there appears to be an underlying negative linear relationship between metabolic rate per unit body mass and lifespan of a given species."
Data,"Figure 7 shows us that the majority of individuals are drinking socially, which is our target of interest."
Lim,"Climate conditions vary greatly worldwide, and conclusions drawn from the study of one forest can only be applied to itself with confidence."
Context,Certain dating services users desire a partner with a specific educational level.
Int,"Because our p-value is greater than our 0.05 threshold, we fail to reject our null hypothesis, meaning that there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a relationship between the day of publication and title length."
RQDef,"In this study, we would like to see how often someone uses drugs affects other factors of their life."
Data,"(2) To answer these research questions, we will be using a dataset that contains measurements of air quality in Chicago, Illinois each day from January 1987 to the end of December 2000"
MethJust,"And the errors I get for the smoothing spline models with effective degrees freedom ranging from 3 to 7 are 0.3593119, 0.3567590, 0.3551119, 0.3543140 and 0.3544876 respectively."
Lim,Again this is because there are a variety of factors that influence an individual species lifespan that arent considered in our data.
Int,"As a result, Jorgensen cannot conclude that reducing the crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% would cause its lifespan to change (2)."
Data,"The dataset we would use (chicago.csv) contains information of Chicago each day from January 1987 to December 2000, including the measurements of air quality, the total number of non-accidental deaths, and the mean temperature."
Struct,The plot below indicates the number of accounts that fall between a certain age range.
MethDef,We are aware that the data is fairly linear but will test for the regression slope.
Int,"However, after log-log transformation, we have no evidence to conclude that the relationship between the log of metabolic rate and the log of lifespan is non-linear."
Data,"For our report, the data set we will be utilizing for analysis is a variety of data on the player performance in the 2010 World Cup that was held in South Africa."
Lim,"Also, notice that since we have a non-constant variance, it is also likely that the metabolic rate depends on some other variable, or some other variable correlated with the metabolic rate contributes to the difference in lifespan."
Int,This may be due to the fact that there appears to be no correlation between the pollutants and number of deaths as we saw in our explanatory data analysis section.
Context,ScienceForums contains discussion forums on a wide range of topics ranging from biological and physical science to religion and philosophy.
MethJust,"Here we have used k-fold cross validation, as it is the most commonly used and general form of cross validation."
MethDef,"We use 1000 bootstrap iterations and our result is a 95% confidence interval of [18.64897, 22.81047]."
Struct,So we would find another standard to determine which pollutant has the strongest association in 4.4
Int,This assertion merely states an associative fact and does not mean that reducing the metabolic rate of a crab-eating raccoon by 50% will increase its lifespan by 43.2%.
Data,"We observe from fig 1 that all physically well groups besides “jacked” have the greatest amount of users who “never” used drugs, with 185 being “fit”, ""201 being “athletic” and 267 being “average”.."
Int,"It is important to note that we cannot make a blanket statement that lowering a species metabolic rate would directly translate to increased mean lifespan, because there are many factors (such as diet and environmental/geographical location) that would also influence a species maximum mean lifespan and arent considering in this dataset."
Res,With observed minimal values of pollutants with fixed temperature of 70 predicted 114.8476 death(5)
MethJust,"(6) According to Figure 8, the residuals violate the gaussian noise assumption."
Int,Figure 2 shows a positive association between costs and duration.
MethDef,We used non-parametric bootstrap to calculate the CI for Model 1.2 to be consistent with Model 5.
RQDef,"Going back to one our original research questions, whether the effect of pollution is instaneous or extends over time, we can use our results from the cross-validation we did for Models 1 and 2"
MethDef,"To compare the two models, we used cross-validation with 10 folds."
MethJust,This means potentially extreme data can display curvature that may not be existent in reality.
Res,"From this table, we see that the most populated cell of the table is average body type while not smoking."
Data,"The sample includes information about 1836 trials that are related to tort, contract, or real property rights trials."
Lim,"As mentioned above, we should use generalized additive models to take the confounder into account."
MethJust,"There are no other observations even close to such high death counts in any year of our data, regardless of the season."
Data,"Furthermore, there seem to be a smaller concentration of users after age 50 in the graph."
Data,The variable Demanded is a quantitative variable that measures the amount a plaintiff requested from court.
RQDef,"Knowing this, we can hypothesize that the higher the moisture content including humidity, the moisture content of deep or shallow organic layers tends to increase as well."
Data,We also see that the minimum total passes for all positions is 0 except for Goalkeeper which has a minimum of 4.
Struct,Table 5 (the following table) are the CI's calculated using parametric bootstrap.
RQDef,And what about relationship status?
Data,"The interquartile range for the Goalkeeper position is between 250 and 400, which is well above the ranges for the other positions."
Res,It signifies that the data points are widely distributed and are not close to each other.
MethDef,"Let muB, muW, muO, muT, muE, muS, muL denote the true mean title lengths for Business, World, Other, Tech, Entertainment, Social Media, and Lifestyle respectively."
Context,This estimation would provide an insight into whether Mr. Jorgensen should invest his money to reduce each pollutant to its lowest level.
Res,We found that there is evidence that the 7 day averages of pollutants are associated with mortality.
MethJust,The test is valid because all groups tested have an np >= 10 and n(1-p) >= 10.
MethJust,"But 'death' has a nonlinear relationsihp with many covariates, which means correlations are not very useful."
RQDef,Our third hypothesis examines if there is a relationship between one’s sex and one’s drinking preference.
Data,The mean age for people who answered “never” was the highest.
RQJust,Both Defender and Goalkeeper positions have a median of 270 minutes while the Midfielder position has a median of 167 minutes and the Forward position has the lowest median of 132 minutes.
Int,"Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no association between sex and drinking habits, and conclude that there is not sufficient evidence for a relationship between sex and drinking habits."
Res,"In the following figure 4, we observe that the the distribution is slightly right skewed with several outliers that have either extremely high ISI or area, such as the point with an ISI of 56.1 and an area of 0.1ha."
Lim,"Also, there is only 347 observations in the dataset."
Lim,"Furthermore, it to have more generalizable data it would be helpful to have observations for more cities in the US other than Chicago (i.e., Miami, New York City, Houston)"
MethDef,"For bootstrapping, we decided to choose the nonparametric bootstrap resampling cases method because we cannot assume that the relationship between our variables is linear."
RQDef,"First, some research has suggested that slowing the metabolic rate may increase lifespan-- is this supported by the evidence."
Data,"Upon closer inspection, the unusually high deaths occurred between July 13, 1995 and July 16, 1995"
Res,"As the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject our null hypothesis and conclude there is a significant effect."
Res,"Therefore, there is not significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis."
Data,There are several outliers on the higher end seen in the boxplot (not displayed)
MethDef,"Therefore, we will remove these four outliers from the data so as to not bias our regression."
Lim,"Currently, the study's scope and the data collected only concern a few variables from a single park over a brief period of time."
Data,The dataset that we are using is a subset of the more than 4000 species contained within the database.
MethDef,(2) We assess the logarithmic transformation of the death rate as we intend to perform Poisson nonparametric generalized additive modeling (GAM) with the log link to model the relationship.
Other,"This time the two quantitative variables in the scatterplot below are subscribers (y-axis), and accountAge (x-axis)."
Int,"One possible explanation for the first quartile being very close to the median while the third is much further is that it is highly difficult for a fire to grow from a small size to a large size, so the data clusters close to zero."
Data,"The 14 features represent different aspects of the species such as its HAGRID (unique ID), scientific classification, Longevity, Metabolic rate, and more."
MethDef,Figure 5 visualizes the scatter plot of the log-transformed lifespan and metabolic rate with a smoothing spline trend line with 6 degrees of freedom.
Data,"Lastly, temperature seems normally distributed with slight left-skewedness but there appears to be no outliers."
Data,"(2, 3) From Figure 1, we notice that a handful of variables of interest in our data set, specifically 'Metabolic.by.mass' (one of our predictor variables) and 'Maximum.longevity.yrs' (our response variable), are strongly right skewed."
Context,It is no secret how integrated social media is in our everyday lives.
MethJust,"The MSE's standard deviation for model A is 65.76276, and that of model B is 65.73493"
Data,"The quantitative variable subscribers, pertains to the number of subscribers a channel has."
Lim,"There are certain limitations in this research, which include that the dataset is from a specific region and thus lacks randomness in sampling and that this report lacks diversity in summary and graphing measures due to variable types employed."
RQDef,The next factor to investigate is the category in which each channel is sorted and how that could affect the views per count the channel receives.
Data,This large difference between the mean and median also shows the skewness of this variable.
Int,"Concerning the small peak in March, a possible explanation this report suggests is that there may be several weeks in March where there is a sudden heatwave or other cyclic condition that lends itself to greater severity fires."
Data,"The least common type of claim is rental/leason, which only includes 92 cases out of 1836 cases."
Data,"The primary variable that this report will be focusing on is age, which is a quantitative variable defined as the user’s age in years, as reported on their profile."
Int,"It is well known that high humidity increases air pollution, while high humidity itself is detrimental to health."
MethJust,The residuals seems constant and normality assumption seems to hold as well although there is a slight deviation in both tails.
MethDef,The great range of variability can be further examined through a boxplot diagram.
MethJust,"Looking at Figure 6, it appears that a line fits the scatter plot generally well, but we might have some concern when using this model to predict an animal's lifespan using its metabolic rate because lifespan seems to largely vary at certain metabolic rates."
Res,"(3) The main findings to the three guiding questions are the following: First, a slower metabolic rate is associated with longer lifespan."
Int,The subscribers become more sparse as viewsPerVideo increase.
Context,"Many teams amass a cult following, large bets are often placed on the teams competing, and extreme pressure is felt by the teams competing to gain the title of the best in the world."
Res,"Analyzing the portion of data from the AnAge database with our model, we concluded that there is a negative relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan."
MethDef,We again found that applying a log transformation to this data resulted in a more normal looking curve although the corresponding normality plot (figure not shown) indicated that it was still not quite as normal as we would like.
MethDef,We also fit five spline models with differing degrees of freedom to account for a more flexible model.
Context,One of the interesting parts of a user's profile is whether they use drugs or not.
Lim,"We could not perform a causal analysis because the dataset was observational, setting limitations to the study."
Data,"$Body.mass.g$ measures the typical body mass of the animal subject in grams, and $Temperature$ measures the typical body temperature of the animal subjects in Kelvins."
MethDef,The covariate terms were also all spline smoothed with degrees of freedom 4
RQDef,Our next research question examine if there is a relationship between relationship status and height.
Struct,We first began by looking into the predictor and response variables individually.
RQDef,Our first research question is to distinguish the number of channels by category.
Int,"For example, people are heavily invested in Tech and Social Media today, but in the future, those interests may change."
Res,"Since this p-value is less than a significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis."
Struct,Figure 3 shows the distribution of user heights in a histogram.
MethDef,"Thus, I apply log transformation on both variables to rectify the skewness."
Data,The last thing we observe is that there are no outliers when looking at all the data.
MethDef,Our first model (model 1) uses the covariates that provide daily measurements (not lagged) and the second model (model 2) uses the covariates that are calculated using 7 day averages (lagged versions)
Res,"In this figure, the boxplots distributions look very similar, in terms of outliers and slight median differences."
MethJust,"Model two, with the lag variables, has an cross-validation error of 187.5841 and an estimated standard of error 22.0151 (2)"
RQDef,"In order to even approach the concept of eternal life, we have to begin by asking ourselves what factors even effect lifespan."
Lim,We might ask for information on the age ranges of the viewers.
Lim,"Considering the rapid changes our environment and atmosphere have gone through due to rapid industrialization and globalization, we can assume that the observed concentrations of pollutants in the atmosphere and mortality back then may not be similar to what they are now."
Data,"The data contains quantitative variables including maximum lifespan (in years), body mass (in grams), metabolic rate (in Watts), and body temperature (in Kelvin)."
Data,'so2median' is the median concentration of sulfur dioxide.
Context,"Preston Jorgensen, an eccentric billionaire who aims to become immortal, is interested in knowing what air pollutant factors are related to non-accidental deaths in order to know whether or not he should spend his enormous fortune to try to reduce pollution."
Data,The main variable of the study is playtime.
RQDef,We will first analyze how views per video vary across the given data set.
Data,The dataset we will be using is the Age Database of Animal Aging and Longevity.
Data,"The identifying variables in the Anage database include: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species, Common.namne for each entry in the database."
Int,"Overall, we can see that on average, the DMC value in forest fires is higher during months when the temperature is warmer, compared to the months where the temperature is colder."
MethJust,"Based on these results, we determined that model 2 (lagged model) provided the best fit for the data since it has the smallest prediction error (0.011542)"
Data,"'metabolic.by.mass', which we will refer to as metabolic rate, is the metabolic rate divided by body mass, which gives us the amount of energy used per unit of body mass."
MethJust,This is also large enough.
Int,"The assumption that the measuring equipment is only able to recognize fires once they have grown to a certain size appears to be flawed, as the data set notes that “any small fire that burned less than 0.1 ha has been capped at 0.1 ha."
Data,The variable play time is a quantitative variable that represents the amount of time a player plays in a match (minutes).
Lim,So the difference between the models does not appear to be significant.
Data,"The primary focus of this study will be about total damages, a quantitative variable that measures the amount of damages the plaintiff received as a result of their trial."
Int,This means we do not have enough data with large values of $SO_2$ to identify the real trend.
Context,"Billionaire Preston Jorgenson has provided us with data on several kinds of air pollution such as Ozone, Sulfur Dioxide, and Particulate matter in the Chicago area so that we can perform analysis and make conclusions on which types of air pollution is most strongly associated with increased mortality rate."
Lim,This may skew the results by trying to predict animals from two different clusters or try to predict an animal using another cluster that it is not in.
Res,"Referring back to figure 3, we can observe directly that August and September have conspicuously higher counts than other months."
Res,"Before any work was done, I thought all the three factors affect the number of subscribers to some extent, however, the exploratory data analysis show there’s no relationship between subscribers and viewsPerVideo, and there’s no relationship between subscribers and videoUploads, whereas there’s a positive linear relationship between subscribers and accountAge."
RQDef,Question 1: Does the number of posts in a thread affect the view count.
Res,"We notice that the red line, which represented the fitted spline from Model 5, is downward-sloping."
MethJust,"On the other hand, model2 find all varaibles to be significant."
Data,The mean number of shots attempted was 2.304 and the standard deviation was 3.347.
Int,"Therefore, we believe that Preston Jorgensen cannot conclude that reducing the 7-day averages of pollutants to historically low levels would cause mortality to decrease to the point estimate we predicted, 109 deaths."
Res,We can conclude that the pollutant variables have an association with deaths in Chicago.
Struct,Table 2 below summarizes the results of the 3 global goodness-of-fit tests.
Data,"Articles are categorically grouped into one out of six channels: Business, World, Other, Tech, Entertainment, Social Media, and Lifestyle, and date of publication."
RQJust,"Also, the magnitude of such correlation coefficients suggests that the relationship between $death.log$ and the lagged variables are stronger than that for the original variables (5)"
Int,"Because this is much greater than our significance value of alpha=0.05, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null, and thus do not have sufficient evidence to say that there is a negative relationship between age and income."
Res,The difference between the two confidence intervals appear to be minor.
Context,"YouTube creators have channels that users subscribe to, and the number of subscribers could determine the success of a creator and therefore their wealth and fame as reported in YouTube’s creator academy: https://creatoracademy.youtube.com/page/lesson/subscriber-advantage)."
MethJust,"This is because the residuals plots lack homoscedasticity, and the qq-plot indicates a possible violation of the residuals' normality (6)."
Struct,"(4) To check if my selected best model model appears to fit well, I plot the original data and the fitted line."
Int,"Not only does Model 2 produces smaller MSE, but this proposition is more consistent with commonsense (3)"
MethJust,"Because we are exploring the relationship between a categorical explanatory and a categorical response variable, the Chi-Square Test is the appropriate test to use."
Int,"Based on this, we would expect that in general, a decrease in metabolic rate results in an increase in lifespan (6)."
Context,"Technology is growing at an exponential rate, and as time passes, more and more people are considering the idea of starting a business and becoming their own boss."
Data,"(2) We are interested in particulate matter, ozone, and sulfur dioxide in particular because ozone gas is toxic when inhaled, sulfur dioxide is a key contributor to acid rain and is toxic to humans, and particulate matter (like soot) when inhaled can become stuck in the lungs and cause severe damage."
MethJust,"(3) We did try a few transformations of the data such as logarithmically modifying the predictors, but none of the transformations improved the correlation."
RQJust,"The best players will most likely have the most play time in a match, thus having more opportunities to attempt to score goals."
Int,"This means that the mean shots attempted for each position is not equal, and we can conclude that there is sufficient evidence for a relationship between position and shots attempted."
Res,"It would make sense that countries with bigger populations have bigger viewsPerVideo on average, however it can be seen through countries like India who have mean viewsPerVideo in the 1,600,000s with a population of over a billion and countries like the United States with mean viewsPerVideo around 4,000,000 with a population of roughly 350 million."
Struct,Let's examine univariate distributions of response and explanatory variables.
Res,"More specifically, an increase in the average level of ozone and PM 10 is closely associated with an increase in mortality (1)"
Lim,"However, we can see that residuals are narrower on the two sides and wider in the middle, indicating some inconsistent variance, which looks like a major error source of our model."
MethJust,(2) It is important to note that based on the uncertainty in your estimates of the prediction error the difference between the models' prediction errors does appear to be significant.
Int,"We determined that the effect of pollution appears to extend over time because we had plausible evidence to conclude that our lagged GAM fit our data better than the non-lagged GAM, indicating that the 7-day averages of atmospheric pollution had a stronger association with 'death' than single day observations."
Data,"The median is 1.03 million, the mean is 2.9 million, the minimum is 4 thousand, and the maximum is 211.3 million (the second highest outlier is 88.8 million)."
Data,Category is a categorical variable that documents the kind of content different accounts are creating.
Data,Our main focus will be on the variable Position.
Data,It represents the maximum lifespan in years.
Context,This is a question studied by generations of scientists.
RQJust,"Some YouTube videos gain many views even if the channel has few subscribers, however, it seems logical that the more subscribers the channel have the more likely it is to get more views on its videos."
Data,"As expected, income is skewed to the right with the most people being from the 0-50,000 income bracket."
Int,The results of this study further imply that a player’s certain position is associated with certain variable statistics that are more prominent within these positions.
Res,"Since the p-value of 0 is below the alpha value of 0.01, we reject the null hypothesis."
Data,"Our information was collected from 77 patients and comes from a paper published in the journal Nature Communications on October 17, 2019 ('Colonizing multidrug-resistant bacteria and the longitudinal evolution of the intestinal microbiome after liver transplantation', Annavajhala et al., Nature Communications' (2019))."
Context,"As climate change continues to increase in severity, there needs to be a concerted effort to analyze forest fires from more areas over a longer period of time, and draw more conclusive results about how we can detect, combat and mitigate the worst wildfires, which are bound to occur in the coming years."
Struct,(4) Figure 5 shows the residuals vs fitted and normality plots for the linear model we chose.
Context,"However, with new medical discoveries being made each year, the promise of uncovering the key to a dramatically enhanced lifespan draws closer and closer."
Res,"We noticed that the lag_pm10median pollution variable appear to be most linearly associated with mortality, compared to the others."
Int,"From these evidences, we can say that there’s a weak but slightly positive linear relationship between ISI and area."
RQDef,"(1) We would also like to use our model to try to accurately predict lifespan based on metabolic rate for all creatures, allowing us to know exactly how much to reduce metabolic rate to generate a specific lifespan."
Data,There appears to be an unusually large outlier of 320.7 parts/billion for the variable $PM_{10}$ when considering the mean $PM_{10}$ value is only -0.27 parts/billion.
Res,"However, we also observed larger standard deviation of the MSEs, which means the result could change for a different choice of folds."
RQDef,"With our best model2, we predicted the death rate using the minimal observed value in the data with temperature set to 70 to answer Jorgensen's question."
Data,"However, in figure 4 we can see a seemingly linear but clearly negative trend between log(Maximum.longevity.yrs) and log(Metabolic.by.mass) (6)."
MethDef,We decided to use log transformations because of the skewness in their shape along with the fact that neither of the variables had zero values in their range.
Int,"To prolong his life, Jorgensen's best course of action would be to invest in a healthy lifestyle with proper exercise and diet because investing in reducing city-wide pollution levels in the hopes of reducing mortality is a lofty and uncertain goal."
Res,"Additionally, the p-value calculated is 2.2e-16 meaning that there is a significant difference between the models."
Int,There isn’t a direct correlation between cost and age and there can also be confounding variables associated with these variables such as genetics or current health conditions.
RQDef,"In this study, we hope to find the relationship between doing these health detriments and body type."
MethJust,"Looking at the below graphs in firgure 7 and summary, the model with both variables log transformed has the highest multiple R-squeared and the relationships appear to be linear."
MethDef,Users who chose “never” are said to be non-drug users.
MethJust,"Additionally, I reran the cross-validation process a few times without a set seed and found that while the linear model consistently did worse than the spline models, the specific degrees of freedom for the best spline model varied between runs."
Int,"It is important to keep in mind, however, that none of this analysis has causal implications."
RQDef,Research Question 1: Is the mean playing time less than 200 minutes.
MethDef,"More specifically, we will construct our model using linear regression and smooth splines."
Int,"The difference between 2 confidence interval is minimal, suggesting they seem support that data may be from poisson distributiion with errors coming from normal distribution(7)"
Int,Through this analysis it has become clear that the relationship between pollutants and mortality is not favorable.
Data,"The variables measuring pollution have been shifted, which means they may contain negative values."
Lim,"Looking ahead, we will cover two limitations to our analysis: (1) Outdated dataset and (2) Not accounting for the multicollinearity between 'temperature' and the air pollutants in our lagged GAM model."
Int,"(2) We cannot say, generally, that lowering pollutants would cause lower death tolls because the data is purely observational, meaning the relationships observed are only associations and we did not have complete control over the factors in this data."
MethDef,"Therefore, we will use the Chi-Square Test again."
Struct,"Figure 5 below shows log-deaths per day over our 13 year time period, staring with in the beginning 1987 and ending at the end of the year 2000"
MethDef,"We decided to use linear and smooth spline models to analyze whether the data can be better fit by a linear model, suggesting that the data is linear, or if a non-linear approach yielded a better fit."
MethJust,"If we look at the plot on the right, we see that the points on the qq-plot are close to the line with the exception of a few points near the edges, but for the most part, these points do not appear to violate the normality assumption here."
MethJust,"While this relationship seems slightly linear, some transformations on the variables may make the relationship appear more linear."
Res,"Because p < 0.05, there’s not significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis."
Data,It is a quantitative variable that represents the number of views on each channel.
Data,"This curated database contains information for over 4,200 different species regarding their aging and life history (2)."
Data,This leaves us with 347 species to explore.
Data,We can see that the title lengths are pretty similar and that there is a little spike in titles revolving around Entertainment.
RQJust,The higher frequency of one category increases its’ chances of getting more views.
Res,"For every 1 Watts/gram metabolic rate decreases, with all other characteristics staying the same, the animal will increase its lifespan by 0.53505 years."
Data,"It has a sample of 517 forest fire cases and contains variables like total burnt area, date, and other features."
Res,"Similarly, July has 32 counts that comprise roughly 6.2% and August has 184 counts that comprise roughly 35.6% of all counts of forest fires."
Context,There were two people in my high school in the same grade who upload youtube videos regularly.
Int,"Therefore, we have discovered that there is a significant difference between the two models and we cannot accept the null hypothesis that the second model, with the lag variables only, is the correct model."
Res,"As depicted by the bar graph above, the United States (shown in light blue) had the greatest number of videos with the greatest amount of views."
Data,The categories correspond to the kind of content that account creates.
Lim,"This is a limitation of our study, and perhaps another model method would be appropriate to allow the inclusion of interaction terms."
MethJust,"Looking at Figure 7, we can see that there is no clear pattern among the residuals, as they seem to show a constant scatter around 0 without any clear outliers."
MethJust,We did not use a parmetric bootstrap or resampling residuals bootstrap because we cannot comment on the residuals distribution.
Int,"As for Mr.Jorgensen, our model suggests that a crab-eating raccoon whose metabolic rate is 50% less than its typical value is expected to have a maximum lifespan of 20.77763 years, which is 43.2% higher than that for a typical crab-eating raccoon (2)."
Int,"On the other hand, diagnosis is not related to the chance of getting an MDRB infection."
RQDef,"The objective of this study is to determine what, if any, factors that appear to be related to longevity and have the potential to increase human lifespan."
Lim,"There are many other factors like health care, wealth, etc., that might make a city have a higher or lower mortality within its population."
MethDef,"We avoid the flaw in the data by comparing two variables that vary by patient, avoiding the effect of variation by sample."
Data,The median duration of stay was 165.5 days.
Data,In the rest of the report we will call these 347 species the AnAge dataset.
Struct,The plots in row 1 are boxplots that show the distribution of $Class$ and how the key variables are distributed among the 4 classes (5).
Data,The temperature variable is distributed such that the majority of the data lies rather uniformly betwen 20 and 80 degrees Farehnehit but there are several low and high outliers.
MethJust,(4) This model does appear to fit well juding by the above plot.
Int,"Using Figures 3 and 4, we can confirm our hypothesis that North America has the largest user base, as out of all of the countries, the United States has the highest views per video, and the Americas continents had the greatest number of channels."
Lim,"We take note of this, but will continue with our study as we will address this in the discussions section of the report."
MethDef,We distinguished the models such that model 1 contains the daily pollutant and temperature covariates and model 2 contains the lagged versions of these variables.
Data,There are no potential outliers in this distribution.
MethDef,"Rather, we should use a resampling of cases approach which only makes the assumption that the log of lifespan and log of metabolic rate variables are independent and identically distributed random variables."
RQJust,"However, it could also depend on the career a person is in."
Data,"We will first conduct univariate analysis on the following eight covariates: $PM_{10}$ (median density of particulate matter), $O_3$ (median concentration of ozone in parts per billion), $SO_2$ (median concentration of sulfur dioxide), 'temperature' (mean temperature in F), and $lagPM_{10}$, $lagO_3$, $lagSO_2$, and 'lag_temperature', which are the 7-day averages of the first four variables."
Lim,"A limitation of this study is that the sample may have been biased since it took data from the 2010 World Cup, which includes world-class players but not average professional league players."
RQDef,"Following our prior study on immortality, we will further explore this domain by looking into the relationship between air pollution and mortality."
MethJust,"Also, in Figure 7, the residulas seem to depend on the predictor."
MethDef,"In terms of data cleaning and preparation, we first decided to remove all observations with NA values."
Context,"In the modern world, the internet serves as an international coordinate which many can use to learn, discuss, and grow."
Int,"Some inspection into these dates reveal that Chicago faced a tremendous heat wave during the July of 1995, resulting in hundreds of deaths in the span of a couple days."
Context,"According to these studies, a decrease in the metabolic rate might lead to an increase in lifespan."
MethJust,"Since we do not see any evident changes over the years as a whole, we can separate our response by season into deaths in summer and deaths in winter."
RQJust,"It seems reasonable to hypothesize that there might be a positive slope in regard to views vs age, as threads which have been around longer may have a better opportunity to receive views."
Context,"People connect with others through social media apps, such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and view everything online."
Data,"The positions of interest are Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder, and Forward."
Data,"This research has a primary focus on the variable area, a quantitative variable that denotes the total area burnt in a forest fire and is measured in hectares (ha)."
MethJust,"First, we have to make sure there is a significantly large sample size for each group."
Res,"After performing the test, an F-score of 15.7301 and p-value of about 0 is found."
RQJust,These differences in proportion informally suggest a relationship between sex and drinking habits.
Res,"The smallest mean is News & Politics, not Sports."
MethJust,"(1) Since we are interested in studying the causal effect of 'Metabolic.by.mass' on 'Maximum.longevity.yrs', so we have to add the confounding variable 'Temperature' to our linear model to predict 'Maximum.longevity.yrs' using 'Metabolic.by.mass'."
MethDef,"First, we will build a GAM, called Model 1, to predict $death$ from all non-lagged variables, which are $time$, $pm10$, $ozone$, $so2$, and $tmpd$ (1)"
MethJust,"Thus, I would determine the lagged GAM as the better model as it achieves lower bias and variance which will allow us to achieve better predictions on new data (3)"
Int,"Looking more in-depth into the data, I found that the days with these extremely high death rates occured over a course of 5 days from July 12 to July 16, 1995 which was known to be the 1995 Chicago Heat Wave."
Res,"The category to record the smallest view count per video, however, was “News & Politics”."
Other,"Secondly, we must have statistically independent measures within each cell."
Other,We also have to make sure the standard deviations of each group are relatively similar to use the ANOVA test.
Int,We can not conclude any causation relationship.
Data,"$death$ measures the number of non-accidental death on particular dates, and it is our response variable (2)"
Int,"The pollutants that are most associated with deaths in Chicago are weekly averages of PM10 and ozone pollution, and sulfur dioxide is not found to be associated with deaths at all."
Data,"The maximum for midfielders and goalkeepers is 570 minutes, the maximum for forwards is 564, and the maximum for defenders is 540."
Data,We can see from the histogram below that this graph is very highly right skewed.
MethDef,"Customarily, we call this log-log transformation."
Lim,It would be helpful to include more data points to improve the model.
Res,"In terms of the correlation between subscriber count and viewsPerVideo, we also found a positive relationship but too small to consider as significant."
Context,"As the world continues to transform into a generation of digitally-centered people, social platforms are beginning to grasp the time and attention of many: YouTube being a popular choice."
MethDef,We have decided to use log transformation on these variables.
MethJust,This observation suggests that we need to perform transformations on our variables.
Data,The lagged covariates follow the same distribution as their respective original variables (not pictured)
Res,The parametric bootstrap gave a tighter confidence interval.
Int,"This is expected since we fix the edf to 4 in each smoother spline, which constrains the model's flexibility."
MethDef,We kept the degrees of freedom at four for all spline smoothing terms for simplicity and speed when conducting our modeling and diagnostics analysis.
MethDef,We created a hypothesis test to conclude whether or not pollutants have an association with mortality.
Int,The metabolic rates are not randomly assigned to animals.
Int,This means only 25% of the channels have less than 1 million subscribers so our contemplation was not backed by the data.
Data,"The next variable, pm10median, is the median density of PM10 pollution (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers)"
MethDef,"(3) To find the best model in this setting, We use 5-fold cross validation to find the average mean square errors and standard errors of spline models with degrees of freedom from 3 to 7 as well as the linear regression model."
Data,There are outliers on the higher end around the years 1995-1996 as shown in the scatterplot of Figure 2
RQDef,"Our analysis focused on OkCupid, and the relationship between sex and three other variables: income, education, and drinking."
Int,"As it turns out, they had a positive, linear, and moderately strong correlation, as quantified by the R value of .682."
Data,"In Figure 2, we see the histogram for the log of 'death', which appears to have a similar shape to the original variable, unimodel and fairly symmetrical with outliers."
MethDef,"With this in mind, we performed log transformation on 'death', and created Figure 2 and 3 for the two groups of covariates (log death appears in both figures)"
Res,"(1) According to our model, animals with lower metabolic rates have longer lifespans."
MethDef,We thus create a nonlinear model by using a smoothing spline on the data.
Res,"However again, the shape of the plot isn’t very linear with a correlation of 0.136."
MethDef,"We are also interested in seeing if the effect of pollution is instantaneous, so we look at the relationship of the lagged, or 7 day averages, of the original variables, as shown in Figure 4"
Data,(6) One important observations is that there does appear to be two clusters of points from looking at the relationships of 'Metabolic.by.mass.log' and 'Body.mass.log.g' and 'Temperature.log'.
Data,There are 4 obvious outliers.
Data,"SFN collected the following data, highlighting variables which differ within discussion forums, from a large compilation of threads within their website."
MethDef,Our selected linear regression model $text{log(Maximum.longevity.yrs)} = beta_0 + beta_1text{log(Metabolic.by.mass)} + beta_2text{Temperature}$ controls the known confounder 'Temperature'.
Struct,So what can we possible perform in the future to improve our results.
MethDef,"To measure this, we will need to conduct an inferential test and we will choose an alpha value of 1%."
Data,"From figure 2, we see that there do not seem to be clear relationships between $death.log$ and $pm10$ or $so2$"
MethDef,"To do such, we will test the following null and alternative hypotheses: $H_0$: $beta_1$ = 0 $H_a$: $beta_1$ $neq$ 0."
MethDef,"Since we assume that more playing time equates to more passes made, we will test for an alternative hypothesis that is greater than 0."
Res,A great number of data points are distant away from the linear fit line and there are a few outliers in the data.
Struct,"When taking a look at Figure 1, which displays the distribution of the views per video, the most notable feature is the shape."
Data,"Drug use is a categorical variable defined as the frequency of which the user takes drugs, with the answers options being NA (answer not entered), never, sometimes, and often."
MethDef,"For this, we conducted a chi squared goodness of fit test for the lagged model."
Res,"The subscriber count is highly dense toward the lower end of subscriber number, which makes sense given that there are some high outliers for the number of video uploads."
MethDef,We can carry out the test at the level of 0.01..
Int,The potential association ozone shows with log-death may be a result of log-death's relationship with temperature and temperature's relationship with ozone.
MethJust,"However, the difference in 10-fold CV error between Model 1 and Model 2 does not seem to be significant, as the difference in CV error (15.7734) is less than the SE of the estimated MSE (which is around 20-22) (3)"
Context,"In conclusion, this analysis can help Youtubers who already exist or are starting up learn how to maximize their viewsPerVideo."
MethJust,"Since this event is such a rare occurence, I would remove these outliers since it would introduce bias and is not representative of an average day (3)"
Data,"Our boxplot shows that again, this variable is right-skewed, and that without some outliers, we might want to focus on observations between -40 and 95"
Res,(6) The bootstrapped 95% confidence interval is 105.668 deaths to 115.582 deaths.
Data,"We see that the data is heavily skewed to the left, leaning towards 0, and the distribution looks normal."
Lim,"(2) (https://www.cellabox.com/single-post/4-most-dangerous-air-pollutants-in-2017) As for limitations in our analysis, I believe that there are potential confounders unaccounted for in the Chicago pollutants dataset that impact non-accidental deaths."
Lim,We note that it seems like some points above a certain threshold appear very flat and so may perhaps be a different group animals and thus will need a different method from the others in predicting their average lifespan.
Context,Professional players aim to raise their football statistics in order to attract the attention of grander teams and therefore get signed and earn more money.
RQDef,Our second hypothesis considers the relationship between drug usage and income.
RQJust,This may suggest that temperature may not only has direct affect on death but also can contribute to other pollutant factors to affect the mortality rate.
Data,"The continuous variables in our dataset are: life span in years (represented by Maximum.longevity.yrs), body mass in grams (represented by Body.mass.g), metabolic rate in watts (represented by Metabolic.rate), temperature in Kelvin (represented by Temperature)."
Struct,"To understand the variable and to motivate the hypothesis test, we first explore and summarize the distribution of posts in relation to views."
Int,This indicates that our model fits the data better than the saturated model due to its lower deviance.
Res,The distribution of subscribers above is strongly skewed to the right and a few outliers at 20 and 25 million subscribers.
Int,"As the p-value for the coefficient on $Metabolic.log$ is less than 0.05, we conclude that lower metabolic rates lead to higher maximum lifespans, under prior assumptions."
Data,'Temperature' : The typical body temperature in Kelvin.
RQJust,"We say since there are more channels under the most frequent category, this also means that there are more videos uploaded which allows for a higher view count."
Data,The dataset only includes lagged versions of the three pollutant variables and the temperature variable which give the 7-day averages of each variable.
Context,"Whatever the reason, it is important for wildfire research and prevention to consider both the likelihood a wildfire will occur in a certain month and the chance it will be significant."
RQDef,"This report will give a detailed analysis of what factors influence views which can help anyone interested in possible becoming a Youtuber, or even a manager for someone else’s Youtube account."
Res,"From the summary, we can see that log(Metabolic.by.mass) is -0.39993, which tells that 'Maximum.longevity.yrs' decreases by 0.3999% when 'Metabolic.by.mass' increases by 1 %."
MethJust,"Since the models have relatively similar perfmance, following Occam's Razor we choose the simpler, linear model."
Context,"Overall, our analysis can help viewers and fans of soccers better understand the game of soccer during the world cup."
Other,We also need to ensure that our standard deviations are all similar between all our groups.
Struct,"Although we were able to run ANOVA tests and chi-squared tests for our study, there were a few limitations."
Int,This may be due to the lack of substitutions for defenders during a game.
MethJust,"If we look at the plot on the left, the points appear to be patternlessly scattered about $x=0$ and so there are seems to be no huge problems related to homoscedasticity."
Int,"This may have an effect on some of the trends for other variables, such as longevity, mass, temperature, etc."
RQDef,With lag varaibles we will also research if the effect of pollution is instantaneous or extend over time.
Int,"Clearly, there was a big event that occurred at this time."
Data,"Lastly, our boxplot of mean temperature variable, or 'tmpd', (Fahrenheit) is relatively normal with a bit of a left-skew, and the values range from -16 to 92, and our mean and median values are 50.19 and 51 respectively."
MethJust,"We then converted the original ""time"" variable in the dataset to a ""date"" variable so that we know the date of the recorded observation rather than the number of days before or after December 31, 1993, which is less useful to our analyses"
Struct,See the graph below for the distribution of topics to channels.
Res,"The confidence interval given by bootstrapping is (107.9474, 112.5893) (6)"
Res,"Our 95% pivotal confidence interval for the mean number of deaths ends up being: [104.20, 113.34] deaths, or approximately 104 to 113 deaths."
Res,"Particularly, the PM10 and ozone concentration polluntants appear to be most associated with mortality."
MethJust,The ANOVA test is justifiable since the group sample sizes are relatively large (the smallest population is 36 > 30).
MethJust,"In general, any linear correlation is weak, suggesting that the underlying relationship between death rate and pollution and temperature is not linear, which means we should choose nonparametric regression models such as a Poisson generalized additive model to assess our data."
Data,"Our key variables are 'time', 'pm10median', 'o3median', 'so2median', 'lag_pm10median', 'lag_o3median', 'lag_so2median', 'tmpd.diff', 'lag_tmpd.diff' (defined in 2.2), and the response 'death'"
Struct,We have presented model diagnostic plot in Figure 7 for the spline model with degrees of freedom being 7.
Data,"When we log-transform the varaible, the range is now from 4.234 to 6.019, with a median of 4.736"
Data,Position is a categorical variable indicating what position a certain player plays.
Struct,"Lastly, we analyzed the distribution of our main quantitative predictor variable, Metabolic.by.mass."
RQJust,We can reasonably hypothesize from this plot that the lagged GAM appears to fit the data better than the non-lagged GAM
Int,"We can conclude that our prediction is that lowering an animal's metabolic rate by half will result in an increased lifespan, however, it is not necessarily true that reducing the Raccoon's metabolic rate by half will directly increase its lifespan."
Res,"We got a 95 % confidence interval as (-0.4558601, -0.3440440)."
Res,"For starters, there is a data point of 211M viewsPerVideo within the Music category."
Int,This would mean that the entertainment sector alone holds about ten times as many channels as the average of the lowest five categories.
Res,"However, we do note that there is a range of metabolisms (from about -8 to -7 on the x-axis (log scale)) where the curve is relatively flat."
Struct,The errors for each of the spline models can be seen in Figure 4.
Context,"Although it is commonly accepted that the defendant should pay damages, the current laws do not state the specific standards to calculate the amount of damages being paid."
MethJust,"After running the Cross-Validation upon the linear and spline model, we found that the SLR model performed worse with a CV error of 0.3662516 and Standard Error of 0.01296822, while our spline model with 6 degrees of freedom performed the best."
Struct,"Beyond just comparing the two models we put together, it is important to understand if the model we selected actually works with our data, rather than just relative to the individual model."
MethDef,"To further explore this, we also noted down the deviances of our lagged and non-lagged GAMs."
Context,"As Preston Jorgensen asks, we are trying to explore the AnAge data to determine what factors appear to be related to lifespan, so that further researches could be conducted to use those factors to attain immortality."
MethDef,"Since our assumptions are met (for the most part), we carry out our test at alpha=0.05."
Data,There is also data on which country and continent each channel came from.
Data,The variable playtime is a quantitative variable that shows the time on the field a certain player got (in minutes).
Struct,Figure 8 shows the time series of deaths and log deaths from 1987 to 2000 without this event.
Data,"This is further indicated since in all of these plots, the means of our variables (blue dashed line) are all greater than their medians (orange dashed line), representing the long right tails' influence on these measurements."
MethDef,"Where beta1 represents the true slope of the association between age and income, for the users of OkCupid in San Francisco."
MethJust,This suggests that a linear model may not be the most appropriate model to explain the trend.
Data,"This new column describes the amount of energy used per unit of body mass, which allows us to compare between animals of different sizes."
Data,"As suggested by the correlation coefficient (-0.192), $death.log$ appears to be negatively associated with $ozone$ (5)"
MethDef,Their effective degrees of freedom range from 3 to 7.
MethDef,"From here on we use the the transformed variables, log(metabolic rate) and log(lifespan)."
MethDef,"If we seek to bootstrap our data, we should use a nonparametric bootstrap."
Data,"The biggest view count was 245,118,098,041 (Ryan ToysReview), while the least number of views was 593,861 (fouseyTUBE)."
MethDef,"To further explore this relationship, we fit a simpler model with just the temperature, or 'lag_tmpd' as a covariate."
Res,Our final findings indicate that there is indeed a relationship between air pollutants and mortality.
MethJust,"Figure 3 shows the new relationship of transformed unit metabolic rate and transformed maximum lifespan, which we could see a clearer relationship of the two variables."
MethDef,"(1) First, we create a new variable called 'Metabolic.by.mass', defined as our original 'Metabolic.rate' divided by our original 'Body.mass.g', that we will use as our metabolic rate for the rest of the report."
Res,"The 95% confidence interval for the mean number of deaths is [4.65,4.70]"
Lim,"There exists a minority who had null answers to this question, creating some bias in the data."
RQDef,"Given a set of attributes for an animal, how accurately can we predict its lifespan."
Data,"In other words, the fluctuating trend and points match with the trend in temperature with varying degree (5)"
Int,This means that these two categorical variables are not independent.
Data,"Moving on to our boxplot of Sulfur Dioxide Pollution, or 'so2median', (sO2), we notice that our values fall between -8.2061 and 28.9034, with mean and median values of -0.6361 and -1.2183 respectively."
RQDef,"However, this project’s goal is to emphasize that there is a relationship between the two values, not look at why that occurs."
Struct,"In figures 1, 2, and 3, we can see a histograms and boxplots for the three air pollutants (daily and lagged)"
Res,"It can be seen in the table that on average those who have Youtube channels that originated in Egypt or the United states get more viewsPerVideo on average, however both have much larger standard deviations than those of other countries."
Data,Account age is a quantitative variable that indicates how long since a given youtube account was created.
Int,"However, we have argued that the difference in CV error is not significant as it is less than the estimated SE of the test errors."
Res,There seems to be no outlier in Africa compared to the other continents.
MethDef,"2 As we transformed the response variable, we predict $Age.log$ first, and we then take the exponential of that as the estimate of $Max.lifespan$."
Res,The chi square deviance test shows that the full lag-model reduces the deviance by 18.86 and is statistically significant at the 99% confidence level with a p-value of 0.0086
Res,We found that there is an association with all 3 types of pollutants with ozone having the strongest correlation.
Res,The slope of the linear regression is 2.4261 and the intercept is 21.5737.
Data,The number of subscribers is a quantitative indicator that represents the number of active users engaging with the channel platform.
Res,Our report and analysis concluded that there is an association between pollutants and mortality.
Int,"However, as we are working wtih observational data, we cannot assume casuality between pollutants and death rate."
Struct,"(4) Next, we explored how the variables were related to each other in order to get a better idea of how to fit models to the data."
Data,"(1) Looking at the distribution graphs of 'Metabolic.by.mass' and 'Body.mass.g' below in figure 1, it is clear that both are right-skewed, which means the mean is greater than the median (as shown in figure 2)."
Data,"We can see that when grouping channels into three categories, most count, middle count, and least count, articles about World, Entertainment, and Tech fall into the most count category."
Res,We can see from the plot in Figure 4 that the trend appears to indicate that there may exist a relationship between an animal's longevity and their metabolic rate.
MethDef,"Since our assumptions are met in the same manner as above, we carry out our test at alpha=0.05."
MethDef,We can visually compare the severity distribution for the two groups of PatientMDRB using a boxplot in Figure 7.
Lim,"Another possible piece of data that can be included are the playing times of previous World Cups, in order to get a better idea of how each World Cup may vary."
Data,"A majority of players seem to have playing times of 249 minutes or less, but there are spikes of players with 250-299 minutes and 350-399 minutes of playing time."
Data,"We have information on a sample of 1259 Youtube Channels, gathered by Social Blade and containing data up to the end of 2018."
RQJust,"After all, it seems reasonable to assume that someone in their 40s or 50s might have a more stable career and increased income compared to a person in their 20s, since they have had more time to develop their career."
Int,"Therefore, this suggests that a lagged model where pollutant and temperature measurements are 7 day averages fit the data better than our model using daily or instantaneous pollution and temperature estimates (3)"
Lim,"Alternatively, perhaps performing a bootstrap regression might improve the linearity given the constant variance violations."
MethDef,"Because of this, we know that the hypotheses are as follows."
Data,"Moreover, by examining the histogram of 'Temperature' (figure not shown), we can see that it is bimodal with a major mode around 310 with data normally distributed around and a much smaller mode around 290 on its long left tail."
Int,"These conclusions seem to suggest that the population of dating sites are not necessarily young adults, and that there might be evidence that the older a person is, the less likely they are to do recreational drugs."
RQDef,We will mainly take a look at the relationship of the number of views per video and the channel topic at hand.
Context,"In the past, when measuring success, companies were able to look at the number of sales in their articles and media."
MethDef,We constructed linear model and spline models to answer the research questions.
MethDef,"To get the point prediction and CI for the $death$, we take the exponents of our prediction and CI for $death.log$"
MethJust,"Looking at the graphs above in figure 9 and our cross-validation prediction error table, we choose 6 as our degress of freedom for our spline model."
Other,"We know that log transformation is a monotone transformation, and it preserves the order of the input."
Struct,"(4) In figure 10 below, we plot all of our individual model terms, which are all splines, by their respective variable data."
Data,All investigations are established on a sample of 517 forest fire cases on the Montesinho natural park.
Int,"Note from the confidence interval that the 95% confidence interval for this prediction is huge, ranging from 6.005374 to 33.61207 years, which means that it is very hard to guarantee prediction accuracy here."
MethJust,"Because each individual is only in one cell of the table, we know that our categories are independent."
Lim,"Specific other variables, such as the time duration of wildfires and the causation of the fire would be appreciated to help produce more accurate conclusions, as would insight into the mechanisms behind identifying and recoding fire data."
Context,"In analyzing the Duff Moisture Content within forest fires in this study and its interactions between other variables, we hope that scientists, environmentalists, and other trained professionals can find a way to mitigate forest fires so that humanity can live in a safer world."
MethDef,"Since our assumptions are met, we can perform the test at level 0.01."
Struct,"With the key variables we explored, lets find the relationship of the two variables using scatter plot."
MethDef,"We found that the outcome ""death"" can be expressed as rate data as the number of counts per day and is appropriate for Poisson regression, removing the need for the predictor variable time"
Data,"To help users monitor their statistics and online presence, the dataset comes from data gathered by Social Blade and contains information up to the end of 2018."
Int,"Based on these pieces of evidence, it is safe to conclude that the country in which a youtube account was created does not directly effect viewsPerVideo."
MethJust,"(3) The difference between the models doesn't appear to be significant because the standard error of the estimate of the prediction error for the first model is 29.6185 and the standard error of the estimate of the prediction error for the second model is 27.622, meaning that the difference between the mean prediction errors is not greater than the uncertainty of either prediction."
Res,"Using this model, we calculate the square root of the Lifespan of a raccoon with a body mass of 1160 grams and a metabolic rate of 1.294 Watts to be approximately 4.45 years, meaning the lifespan of the raccoon would be 19.78 years."
Res,"As observed from previous figures and analysis, there does appear to be a negative relationship between Lifespan and Metabolic rate."
MethDef,Ha: There is an association between sex and drug habits (sex and drug habits are dependent).
MethJust,"Third, the non-linear regression line (red) deviates greatly from the linear regression line (blue) for many covariates."
Struct,We will explore how these proportions relate to the other variables discussed in the following sections.
Data,PM10 most closely resembled the trend in O3 wehreas PM10 was scaled to small size.
Lim,"As mentioned earlier, it would have been useful to measure more weather related characteristics other than temperature such as humidity levels."
Lim,Both of these factors would affect the data and our conclusions.
MethDef,"Since this misalignment can bias the regression, we will proceed with removing the four observations recorded during Chicago's heat wave."
MethJust,So the models don't seem to differ significantly in performance.
Struct,"Now that we have chosen our best predicitive model, we will run diagnostics on the spline model (df = 5) to better understand its strengths and weaknesses."
Int,"If we assume that $Class$, $Body.mass.g$, and $Temperature$ are the only three confounding variables, then we could claim that reducing the metabolic rate of a crab-eating raccoon will increase its maximum lifespan by 1.9 years."
Data,"Comparing these histograms to those in figures 1 and 2, we can see that both variables are more centered and are less skewed to the right."
Lim,"In addition, we also don’t know if there is a lurking variable that can explain why DMC is higher in the summer months compared to the winter months."
Data,"The number of views per video is a quantitative measurement of how many views each video records, on average, for each channel."
MethJust,"However for our lagged GAM, the model considered all four variables (pm10median, o3median, so2median, and tmpd) to be significant (p<0.05)"
Struct,"(4) In Figure 4 below, we display the diagnostic plots related to our smoothing spline with 6 degrees of freedom."
Int,"For claim type analysis, it suggests that those who claim fraud may receive higher amounts of damages compared to others since it has the highest mean and median for TotalDamages."
Res,"In running the hypothesis test, we obtained a t-value of -0.8083 and a p-value of 0.419."
MethJust,"In our dataset, the unusually high deaths on these four days don't seem to be explained well by the temperatures recorded on those days."
Data,"(6) According to Figure 4, as metabolic by mass decreases, lifespan increases."
Data,"“Often”, represented by the red, has the lowest median, with 26.5 years."
Data,"We will also be examining the 7-day averages of the temperature, median ozone concentration, median sulfur dioxide concentration, and median density of $PM_{10}$ pollution variables, as they may be helpful in allowing us to assess whether any underlying relationship between pollution and death rate is instantaneous or extends over time."
MethDef,"Given that we will be using poisson generalized additive models (GAM), we will examine the log transformation of our death variable."
Res,"(3) The main findings to the three guiding questions are the following: First, pollutants like ozone, SO$_{2}$, and PM$_{10}$ are associated with increased deaths."
Int,The model would in fact support the conclusion that reducing the metabolic rate would cause this particular increase in the mean lifespan of an animal.
RQDef,It analyzed its relationship with the month of the year and the relative humidity in which the fires occurred.
Struct,"We will first analyze playtime by each of the positions played, and this analysis is shown in the table below."
RQDef,"As we proceed with our lagged GAM, we want to further evaluate how well our model fits our data, and if another model may be better in comparison."
Struct,"Note that all of the histograms indicate significant skew, which we will address later in the transformations section of the report."
RQDef,"In order to determine whether pollutants are associated with mortality, we want to fit a model that uses only temperature as a feature, and no pollutant variables."
MethJust,"Of the spline models, the spline model with degrees of freedom = 5 had the lowest estimated MSE of predicition error at approximately 0.3542 as can be seen in Figure 6 (3)."
Res,"In Figure 1, we can see that the music category has the most outliers and is heavily positively skewed."
MethJust,"However, it is possible that a transformation of the data could yield a more promising relationship."
MethJust,"For our comparison, we have two categorical statistics, independent measurements within each cell, an expected count of at least five so we use the Chi-Square Test of Independence."
MethDef,We decided to perform 5-fold cross validation.
Int,"Thus, the increase in mortality could be attributed to bad health caused by the high humidity instead of air pollution."
Res,"Note that the uncertainty for the covariates the particulate matter, ozone, and sulfur dioxide seem to be much higher than that of the temperature variable."
MethJust,"If the smoothed spline models perform better than the linear model we created, we can take it as an indication that the relationship is better modeled in a non-parametric way."
Res,"We have a 95% confidence interval of [0.3805,1]."
Lim,"It is possible that the inclusion of these pollutants could have change our model selection, findings, and subsequent recommendations for Jorgenson when it comes to investing in ways to mitigate pollution and reduce mortality."
Res,"Through a hypothesis test of anova, our results show that our p-value is less than 2.2e-16, and our deviance is 236.59"
Struct,"Next, we analyzed our models applied to the original covariates and lagged covariates."
Lim,"We maintain that lower observations of average pollutants likely lead to lower death counts in Chicago, however more analysis should be done to bolster this claim independent of the season."
RQDef,"Is the effect of pollution instantaneous (i.e., the amount of pollution on a certain day only affects death rate on that same day), or does it extend over time (i.e., it affects the death rate over the next few days)"
Data,Another thing we observe is that the interquartile ranges for all positions is between 0 and 10 shots attempted.
RQJust,"Thus, we expect that models using the lagged variables are likely to perform better than the model using the original variables (5)"
RQJust,The Defender position has a median of 1 shot attempted while the Midfielder position has a median of 2 shots attempted and the Forward position has the greatests median of 3 shots attempted.
Struct,(3) There exists some limitations to my analysis that might affect my conclusions.
MethJust,"(4) However, for my chosen linear regression model, as points seem to spread out more around 0 and then shrink closer back to 0 as fitted values increase, heteroskedasticity can be discerned from the Residual vs Fitted diagnostic plot, which indicates that residuals are not indepedent of the feature, we need to use the non-parametric bootstrapping with resampling cases to show if animals with lower metabolic rates have longer lifespans."
RQDef,We hypothesize that status could indicate a user’s age or equivalently that there is a relationship between age and status.
Data,"The Age Database of Animal Aging and Longevity is a curated database of ageing and life history in animals, including extensive longevity records."
Res,"There are more than 500 channels that categorized themselves as Entertainment (count of 517), whereas Music comes in second with almost 200 channels (count of 204)."
Lim,It's possible that there are other confounding factors that would influence Lifespan as well that we did not examine further or include in our chosen model.
Data,"We will be using a set of data from each day in Chicago, Illinois between January 1, 1987 to December 31, 2000"
Lim,"One limitation is that our model's residuals lacked homoscedasticity, and there were also signs that our residuals may not be normal."
MethDef,"As for additional covariates, we examined the addition of the temperature variable (kelvin) to the linear model both with a log transformation and without one."
Data,"The set of data includes a measurement of time (the date of observation), the death rate (number of people that died non-accidentally in a given day), and the mean temperature (Fahrenheit."
Struct,We will start by exploring our response variable.
Res,"Therefore, we conclude that metabolic rate is negatively associated with the maximum lifespan of the animal subjects in our data (1)."
Data,"(2) Using 5144 observations of data from the CDC, we modeled the number of expected deaths per day using measurements of PM10, ozone, sulfur dioxide and temperature over time."
RQDef,He also tasked us with finding out whether the effects of pollutants impact deaths immediately or if there is more of a lingering effect where pollutant level impact deaths over several days.
Context,"However due to current scientific and technological limitations, there are certain things that even billions of dollar cant buy a person."
Int,"Severity of liver disease is also related to the chance of getting an MDRB infection, with a more severe liver disease leading to a higher chance of infection within a year of getting a transplant."
Int,"Because the p-value is less than the threshold of .05, a relationship exists between drinking and body type."
Lim,"Another limitation may be that other variable statistics not in the data were not tested, such as goals made."
Data,"To answer our research question, we will use data $Anage$ from the AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity, which is a database of animal's aging and life history."
Lim,To improve our model to address this minor error of heteroskedasticity we could have used a robust GAM which includes robust standard errors within our spline smoothing functions in the model.
Res,Our ANOVA test returns an F Score of 1.646 and a p-value of 0.1302.
Context,"As this market increases, it is critical to understand how these apps and websites can feed and inform how sex and gender interacts with other societal norms."
Context,"Air pollution is one of the major problems that reside in our society, and a problem to tackle onforth."
Res,There is a heavy concentration of data points when both values of viewsPerVideo and number of subscribers are on the lower end.
Data,"In addition, we also find that 'log.maximum.longevity.yrs' and 'Temperature' does not seem to have a linear relationship even after transformation, but a medium to strong correlation between 'Temperature' and 'log.metabolic.by.mass'."
Struct,"Before we move on to the log-transformed scatter plots, we want to quickly analyze our response variable log(death) versus time."
MethDef,We used a scatterplot to compare the relationship between Age and Duration of Stay.
MethJust,"Looking at the qqplot, we can see that the points closely follow the diagonal without any deviations at the tails."
Struct,We will need to do further analysis.
Struct,"Table 1, located above, displays the mean and standard deviation in viewsPerVideo of each channel category, and there are a few notable features."
Context,Some hospital stays are more expensive than others in which special equipment is used in cases such as life support.
Res,The median number of views for India is around 1.379 million views.
Data,"Similarly, the log of deaths appears to be relatively constant across temperatures with possibly a slight negative slope such that the log of deaths decrease as temperature increases."
Data,"There is a slight positive correlation between temperature and the 7-day average of O3, lag_O3median."
Res,"However, among accounts older than 200 weeks old, there does not seem to be an increase in subscriber count as age increases, but we do see a decrease in the number of accounts with a lower subscriber count."
Data,"The smallest values for lagged PM10, ozone, and sulfur dioxide are -24.12 $mg/m^3$, -18.92 ppb, -4.64 ppb respectively."
MethJust,"However, we decided not to remove these outliers because they are explained by the temperature variable already included in the data."
Res,"From the table above, we can see that the category with the biggest mean of subscribers is Comedy, not Entertainment."
RQJust,"The more channels there are under one category, the better chance that that specific category will have more views compared to a category that has a lesser count."
RQDef,Is there a linear relationship between playing time and total passes.
Lim,"This would probably restrict our species to those within the same family, maybe order."
Struct,The variable of age was already somewhat explained in the Dataset section above.
Res,Our model estimates that a 50% lower metabolic rate would correspond to a new mean life span of 20.11787 years (2) .
Res,"Looking at the histogram above, we can see that most of the channels have a smaller number of subscribers."
Int,"The value 0 suggests that there is significant evidence to rejects model2 in favor of a ""saturated"" model with 4 degrees of freedom"
Lim,"This data does not have information on characteristics of the content creaters such as age, race/ethnicity, or their intended audience (kids, young adults, adults, etc.) ."
Data,"To formulate this hypothesis, we will need to focus on the mean playtime for each position."
Lim,"Since our predicted values for spline and linear model were very close, it is conceivable that a different seed would have resulted in the investigation of the linear model instead."
Int,"Overall, we found that there is a relationship between sex and income, as originally hypothesized, with women making less than their men."
Res,There is only one account less than 150 weeks old that has more than 10 million subscribers.
RQJust,A player’s play time is also largely determined by their skill level.
RQDef,"Our goal with these variables is to analyze and observe the relationship between the three types of pollutants (ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particular matters) and determine which pollutant has the strongest effect on death rate."
Context,"While anyone above the age of 18 can create an account, each profile is unique and everyone will encounter different experiences."
Context,The one with less subscribers created his account during his senior year of high school and focused mainly on music.
Struct,Our analysis had limitations that might affect our conclusions.
Int,"Therefore, we do not reject the null hypothesis and notice that there is a similar view count among the varying forums, despite how much they differ."
Res,"In Figure 2, we are immediately able to take note of the outliers with an incredibly large viewsPerVideo count."
Data,The most common answer is “socially” with 1036 users and the least common answer is “desperately” with 7 users.
MethDef,"Let p(M) denote the population probability of men who earned a million dollars, and let p(F) denote the population probability of women who earned a million dollars."
Data,The median is 266 weeks and the range is 667 weeks.
MethDef,"Therefore, we will need to perform a formal hypothesis test."
Res,"In running the hypothesis test, we obtained a t-value of -0.8083 and a p-value of 0.419."
Context,It is believed that air pollution and extreme temperature are associated with increased deaths.
RQDef,We hypothesize that there is a relationship between a player’s position and their total passes.
Data,The histogram visualizes the distribution of these variables as being skewed right without a normal distribution.
Data,The median age was 60.
Context,"High levels of humidity can cause respitory issues for the elderly and individuals with respitory illnesses (i.e., Asthma) that can lead to health complications such as pneumonia and ultimately death."
Struct,This poses an interesting question into the limitations of our model.
MethJust,"Similar to Metabolic Rate, the original plot was quite heavily skewed to the left (3)."
Data,"(3) The feature variable 'metabolic.by.mass' also has a very right-skewed distribution with some large outliers, therefore a log-transformation is needed."
Int,"However, because of potential overlooked assumptions, inaccuracies in data, or other factors, we can not say that lowering pollution will absolutely decrease mortality (2)"
Int,"Therefore, we do not have enough evidence to conclude whether the effect of pollution on mortality is instantaneous or propagates over time (3)"
Int,"From this, content creators can understand that they can still garner many views if they have a lower number of subscribers."
Res,The data is right skewed in which most of the data points form clusters near zero.
MethDef,We will start by fitting a linear model to the log transformed variables.
Data,"DC (Drought Code) is a quantitative variable similar to the measure of DC, except it doesn’t take humidity into account."
Data,"The variable has mean of 16.01 years, median of 12.90 years and range of 2.50 years to 122.50 years."
Res,"June and July, which are the other two months referred to in the research question, have conspicuously lower counts than August and September."
Int,This is probably due to the fact that more posts means more interaction and content to visit.
MethJust,"Although the relationship between the transformed variables is linear, we decided to use a non-parametric smoothing spline model because it yielded the lowest prediction errors among the models tested, including the linear model."
Res,"The predicted mean deaths on a 70-degree day when the pollutants are the minimum values recorded is about 110 deaths, which is not very different from the average number of deaths in this dataset, at around 115"
Int,"However, the latter suggestion is more plausible as its corresponding model yields slightly better performance, and it is consistent with commonsense."
Lim,"First, in my fitted model, there seems to be an unexplained negative trend in the residuals, which suggests a more flexible model."
Data,"In each plot, there are several outliers that indicate that certain dates just had many more deaths than usual."
Int,We conclude that it's not reasonable for Mr. Jorgensen to fund research to reduce the level of pollutants in his environment because pollution treatments can be expensive and nearly impossible to maintain over time.
Struct,"Next, we will examine the model and residual diagnostics for our selected plot."
Data,It is important to note that these outliers are plotted at zero values for the pm10 and sulfur dioxide pollutants while they are plotted at high values of the ozone pollutant and temperature.
MethJust,"Note that np >= 10 and n(1-p) >= 10 for groups of drug use tested, so the test is valid."
Res,The pivotal bootstrapping method seems to have a slightly wider confidence interval between 104 and 121 deaths.
RQDef,We want to start by addressing the first question regarding the relationship between lifespan and metabolic rate.
Struct,(3) Figure 15 demonstrates analytic plots for our chosen model.
Struct,Further analysis in later sections will explore the linearity of the relation.
Res,"Our Chi-Square Test produces a test statistic of Chi-Sq=5.9983, and a p-value of 0.1117."
Struct,We can also look at the distribution of points shown as rug marks along the x-axis of each plot.
Context,"We are looking at data to help you, Preston Jorgensen, research different ways that might extend your life."
Struct,"Having summarized the variable, we now turn to the formal hypothesis test."
MethDef,"For each of the 1000 rounds of bootstrap, we first construct the model under the bootstrapped sample, and we estimate Age.log of the crab-eating raccoon whose metabolic rate is 50% less than its typical value."
Int,"However, unlike originally hypothesized, there is no relationship between sex and education, and sex and drinking."
Data,"As shown in figure 3, diversity has a unimodal and left skewed distribution."
Struct,Below is the scatterplot representing the relationship between the two quantitative variables.
RQDef,Our second question is going to be analyzing the DMC per month.
Data,The three scenarios in the next section will also include the variable Demanded and ClaimType.
Int,"In context, we do not have sufficient evidence that player position does affect playing time."
Res,"After extensive analysis, we conclude that animals with slower metabolic rates tend to have a higher life expectancy."
Data,"This dataset is compiled from hundreds of scientific papers, for over 4,200 species."
Lim,The data set was too random to see relationships.
Data,The maximum lifespan of the crab-eating raccoon is 19 years in our dataset (2).
Res,The closest bounds have about a 6 person difference between them.
Res,The difference between the two confidence intervals is that the confidence interval of the bootstrap is much narrower and smaller than that of the smallest values confidence interval.
RQJust,"To collect data on a wildfire, there must be some form of sensor which causes data recording to occur at a certain trigger in order to avoid false positives."
RQJust,"Based on these observations, we can expect ozone and temperature may have similar effects on our model."
Data,"The mean amount of subscribers was 3,201,757, and the Median was 1,949,612."
Int,This spike was due to a heat wave that took place in the summer or 1995 that killed an large number of people in Chicago.
Struct,(5) Figure 3 has the scatter plot that shows us the relationship between log metabolic rate and log lifepsan.
Data,"The pollution variables do not have a clear relationship with our response, but it seems that ozone may also have a negative relationship with log-death."
Context,"At least half of sexual victimization and abuse occurs when the woman is drunk, whether that is due to not being able to give consent or having their drink be roofied (as detailed, for instance, in The US National Library of Medicine, Nov 9th, 2009, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2784921/)."
Int,Therefore we do not have enough evidence to prove that there is a relationship between the category of a channel and the speed at which the subscriber count will increase.
MethJust,"In Figure 2, we see the updated histogram for log(lifespan) shows a fairly normal distribution and the updated histroram for log(metabolic rate) shows a fairly normal distribution and a small left-skew."
MethDef,We found that using a smoothed spline model (df = 5) fits our data best.
MethJust,Please note that I included my time (month and year) variables in my null model as well because they are also included in my lag-model and leaving them out would not yield accurate results for this question.
Res,This is because the line in the middle of each box plot representing the median has the largest value for August compared to any other month.
MethDef,"As a result, we will be using log(Lifespan) and log(Metabolic.by.mass) in the rest of our analysis."
Int,This affirms that it is the content of the videos that are leading to the high views.
Context,One of the most watched and anticipated sporting events around the world is the World Cup.
MethJust,We must run this test because the sigma is unknown for the population.
Data,$so2$ and $lag_so2$ both follows right-skewed distribution.
Data,"Since all the categorical variables are taxonomic classfication information of the species, or the common name, we do not consider them as key variables in this study."
MethJust,"For “sometimes”, there are 310 people."
Int,(2) Preston Joregensen can conclude that reducing the crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% increases its lifespan years from 19 to 28.42159.
Lim,It may have been useful to control for other characteristics such as caloric consumption and endangered species classifications.
Struct,We will begin by looking at the variables individually.
MethJust,"In addition to fitting a linear model, we also want to try and fit a more sophisticated and flexible model."
MethDef,Linear model: $ln(Lifespan_i) = beta_1 ln(Metabolic  Rate_i) + epsilon_i$ (1) Smooth Spline models: $ln(Lifespan_i) = s_{df}(ln(Metabolic  Rate_i)) + epsilon_i$ (2).
Data,"Looking at this scatterplot, we can see that their relationship is inverse but it is certainly not linear."
Data,"Although alcohol is a drug in itself, it gets its own category on an OkCupid profile from drug use."
Int,"This means that the values in the interval are values for the estimated slope, $beta_1$, that are consistent with the data and model assumptions for the prediction of the square root of the lifespan of a species based on the square root of their metabolic rate per unit body mass of the species."
Int,"However, since the standard error of the estimate of $SO_2$'s effect is very large, we have no evidence to conclude that $SO_2$ can significantly predict mortality (1)"
Res,The slope of the linear regression is -58.1931 and the intercept is 6216.9529.
MethJust,"By examining the p-value and confidence intervals of $beta_2$, we find that it has p-value of 2.10e-08 and confidence intervals [0.02833105, 0.05788089] at significance level $alpha = 0.05$."
Res,"Since the p-values is smaller than 2.2e-16, we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that Model Lag_tmpt is better."
Data,"According to this plot, the oldest account was created 692 weeks ago."
Struct,"From our study of the OkCupid dating app, we have found a few crucial relationships dealing with drug usage."
Data,None of the entries in our dataset have missing variables (2).
Res,We notice that the CI's are generally narrower.
Int,"What we found was that only the consecutive dates (07/13 - 07/16) in the summer of 1995, the most egregious instances of our potential outliers, had a record of abnormal circumstances."
MethJust,"Because we have random sample, a sufficiently large population, and a sufficiently large sample size (n=1500>40), the smallest and largest sample standard deviations (7.159 and 10.410) are within a factor of two, and we are comparing means from independent populations, we can justify the use of an ANOVA test."
Int,"Thus, reducing the level of air pollution will not necessarily lead to a decrease in mortality."
RQDef,The second question is if the effect of pollution is instantaneous or extended over time.
MethJust,"Along with the evidence from univariate EDA, we are confident that this log-transformation is necessary for our study."
RQDef,"As a result, researchers are interested in investigating some of the characteristics displayed in a user’s profile to get a better understanding of OkCupid’s user population."
Struct,We will investigate these potential outliers further in the next section.
MethDef,We can then further investigate the relationship between the attempted shots and the position graphically with boxplots.
RQDef,"(1) In this report, we try to explore the AnAge dataset and analyze the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan."
Int,"As such, the data does not appear to support a strong linear association between RH and area."
Data,"We also see that the minimum for midfielders and defenders is 1 minute, the minimum for forwards is 2, and the minimum for goalkeepers is 45."
Res,"While we can see that the month of August has the max value for DMC of 273.8, we have to look at the outliers from other months which have surpassed that value."
RQDef,"Therefore, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the mean age of OkCupid users in San Francisco at the time of data collection is over 30 years old."
Struct,These models can be seen below.
MethJust,"However, we include it in the analysis as we feel that it's essential for us to answer the casual question."
Int,It may also be a cause of goalkeepers (they tend to play the whole match all the time).
RQDef,"As such, this report will focus on the varying popularity of the different categories of YouTube videos, as well as which countries favor these categories the most."
MethDef,We used a scatterplot to compare the cost of claims to the duration of hospital stay.
Struct,"In figure 1 below, we display the histograms of each variable."
Data,"The distribution of covariates measuring air quality $PM_{10}$, $O_3$, and $SO_2$ are all right-skewed, while the covariate measuring 'temperature' is slightly left-skewed."
MethJust,"We have chosen to include 'tmpd' as a covariate based on our EDA, since it appears to have a strong relationship that must be accounted for with 'death'"
Data,"As seen in figure 1, a majority of samples (63.6%) did not have MDRB, however, figure 2 shows that a much lower percentage of samples (25.4%) were associated with a patient who did not have a MDRB infection."
RQDef,The first hypothesis will be about the mean of the variable: Shots Attempted.
RQDef,"We will be answering the following questions: (1) Is there evidence that the pollutants we mention in our analysis are associated with increased mortality, and which one is most strongly associated with mortality, (2) Is the effect of pollution on death rate instantaneous or does it extend over time, and (3) What is the mean death rate for Chicago on a typical 70-degree day if we lowered the level of all pollutants to match the lowest value ever recorded for those pollutants."
Int,It is safe to say that videos uploaded in the United States have a higher chance of doing well given the findings from Figures 4 and 5.
Int,High temperatures do not have a large impact on sulfur dioxide and PM10 but it does speed up the chemical processes for ozone air pollutants.
Struct,It was clear which variables to use in the models.
MethDef,"It will be a linear regression that fits the relationship between the response variable, log(maximum.longevity.yrs), and the main predictor variable, log(metabolic.by.mass)."
Res,"After fitting the data, I get the following model: $Lifespan = -0.39993 Metabolic + 0.14920$."
Data,Diversity is a quantitative variable and a measure of how diverse each stool sample’s microbiome is.
Lim,Gases such as nitrogen were not part of this analysis.
Struct,"Now that we have selected a model and run diagnostics, its time to utilze our model to answer the research questions."
Struct,"In table 3, we also provide the standard deviation ($SD$) and the standard error ($SE$) of the LOOCV error."
RQJust,We can see that both Defender and Goalkeeper positions tend to get more playing time than Midfielder and Forward positions.
Data,"That being, metabolic rate is our key covariate used to predict our response variable, lifespan (1)."
Struct,"Lastly, we also looked at the summaries for both the predictor and response variables."
Res,"While there does appear to be greater severity in fires during the summer and less during the winter, the greatest wildfires occur in the first month of autumn, and there is also a small rise in fires in March."
Data,Oceania and Africa have far less channels (26 and 16 respectively).
Data,"There was a mean of 1,346,843,185.938 views and a standard deviation of 2,036,809,998.695 views."
MethJust,"Thus, no assumptions are severely violated for model 1.2, which means we could directly use the p-value returned by the regression output."
Int,"As our pValue is less than 0.05, we reject our null hypothesis that the income yearly earnings of men and women are equal."
Int,"This means that we are 95% confident that the true estimated lifespan for a Crab-Eating Raccoon with a 50% reduced metabolic rate lies within our interval of [18.64897, 22.81047]."
Int,It does not explain the cause of the one variable on another.
RQDef,"In this project, we examine how different traits within a discussion forum affect the view count and success."
MethDef,"(1) First, we will construct a basic linear fit predicting 'Maximum.longevity.yrs' by mass-adjusted metabolism."
Data,"The last thing we observe is that there are some outliers above the upper fence in all positions, but the Forward position has the most and the highest."
Struct,"As in our first research scenario, we assess our hypotheses with a formal inference for contingency tables."
Struct,There are a few relationships of notes.
Data,"As shown in Figure 2, the histogram that displays the distributions of the users’ age is unimodal and skewed right."
Res,"Comparing these two intervals, we can see that the one from the bootstrap is slightly wider, but very similar to that of the predict function."
RQDef,Our last research question investigates whether there is a linear relationship between play time and the number of shots attempted.
Data,"As the Figure 3 below shows, there does not seem to exist relationship between these varaibles."
Struct,(4) Now we want to analyze our selected best model.
Res,"If we take a look at Figure 3, even though it is severally zoomed out, we can see the viewsPerVideo vs subscribers isn’t linear."
Context,There is a wide range of forums within the SFN website.
RQDef,"Since Youtube was founded in the United States, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the United States would hold the most significant number of channels and categories within this country."
MethDef,So we converted it into calendar date and made it a categorical variable - 'date'
RQDef,"If there is a relationship, then we will try to find pollutants that is most strongly associated with mortality."
RQDef,"Lastly, what does our model estimate for the mean lifespan of an animal with the crab-eating raccoon's characteristics but a 50 % smaller metabolic rate."
RQDef,We hypothesize that there is a relationship between a player’s position and their playtime.
RQDef,"As different age groups might have have different rates of risk taking behavior like drugs, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that, on average, different frequencies of drug-taking will have different mean age groups."
MethJust,"Looking at the plots, the models do appear to fit well."
Res,Deaths and quantity of pollutants in the air have a positive correlation through a Poisson generalized additive model.
Int,"This means that as RH increases, the corresponding area decreases by 0.3 percent of RH change."
MethJust,"As you can see from Figure 1, the standard deviations are relatively similar."
Struct,The figure below shows the average relationship between each variable and the outcome with +/- 2 standard deviations.
Res,The ANOVA test returns an F-score of 25.4705 and a P-value of 0 < 0.05.
Int,"To test their expected affect on deaths, we were able to compare our predicted death toll from our model for values of lowest observed average pollution to the average expected death toll generally, and were able to conclude that low average pollution values lead to low expected death tolls in Chicago."
Int,Figure 1 and Figure 2 show us that accounts that release music video content are most likely to gain high videos.
RQDef,"Since ISI indicates the spread rate of a forest fire, it is reasonable to hypothesize that there is a positive relationship between area and ISI."
Struct,"While the plots on the upper part off the diagonal show the correlation coefficients between the key variables, the ones below the diagonal are scatterplots between the key continuous variables."
Int,"Looking up these dates, we see that in 1995 there was a very deadly heat wave in Chicago that is the reason for these outliers."
Struct,While Figure 7 shows the same relationships but with the lagged predictors.
Data,"The last thing we observe is that there are some outliers above the upper fence in all positions, but the Midfielder position has the highest."
RQDef,"In this analysis, we used the poisson generalized additive models to examine the relationship between atmospheric pollutants and mortality."
Struct,We want to explore the key variables needed to answer our research questions mentioned above.
Int,"Therefore, men and women drink socially the same amount."
RQDef,"Furthermore, we would like to use our proposed model to estimate the confidence interval for the mean lifespan of a raccoon experiencing a 50% decrease in metabolic rate."
Data,The accountAge is measured by the age of the account in weeks.
RQJust,"Also, the number of subscribers may not establish a direct relationship at all times due to YouTube algorithms increasing or decreasing exposure of videos that we are unaware of."
Data,The lagged versions of the scatterplots are very similar and don't contribute much more information.
RQDef,"(1) In this report we were able to model the expected number of deaths in Chicago using variables measuring pollution, temperature and time."
Res,Using the predict function we get a fitted value of 110.3491 and a 95% confidence interval of (106.2680 114.4302) (5)
Data,"However the data used in this investigation was created by a python script that gathered data from public profiles on the company’s website, www.ok.cupid.com that consisted of 1500 active users on 06/30/2012."
Int,"In conclusion, an increase in air pollution is associated with an increase in mortality in Chicago, even after controlling for the effect of time and temperature (1)"
RQDef,"(6) We would like to determine if this estimate for the expected number of deaths in Chicago during the lowest pollution observations is any different from the expected number of deaths in general, according to our lag-model."
MethDef,To determine how well our lagged model fits the data we conducted a global goodness-of-fit test.
Struct,"Initially, we observed univariate distributions of metabolic rate (Watts), body mass (grams), lifespan (years), and the metabolic rate per body mass (Watts per grams) as these are going to be the key variables in our model."
MethJust,The data points are clusterd in the lower left corner.
Data,"The mode is right skewed with several outliers that have extremely high values up to about 1090 ha, thus explaining the great difference between mean and median."
Data,It is a quantitative variable counting the number of people subscribed to each channel.
Int,"Based on the cross-validation we did in 3.2, the effect of pollution appears to extend over time."
MethDef,We will use cross-validation (CV) to select between Model 1 and 2
Context,"Better yet, videos posted on YouTube are becoming monetized (even unwillingly now according to the Nov.18.2020 Forbes article : https://www.forbes.com /sites/johnkoetsier/2020/11/18/youtube-will-now-show-ads-on-all-videos-even-if-creators-dont-want-them/?sh=6faeaaa54913) , and creators strive to push out content in hopes to attain higher views per video."
Lim,"Further analysis could be conducted with the variable of Team as well, to investigate whether there is a relationship between Team and playtime, and team and total passes."
Res,"Since these three are all heavily positively skewed, the average is to be higher than the median."
Data,"I will use ""metabolic by mass"" instead of ""metabolic rate"" in the rest of my report."
Struct,"Finally, there are still limitations within our analysis that we need to account for."
Res,Estimated Total Passes = -5.98 + 0.43 * PlayTime.
Data,"Drug use is a categorical variable defined as the frequency of which the user takes drugs, with the answers options being NA (answer not entered), never, sometimes, and often."
MethDef,Our null and alternative hypotheses are.
Struct,"Table 1 presents a summary of the 10-fold CV error of Model 1 and Model 2, with estimated standard error (SE) (2)"
Struct,We are now going to recreate and display the pairs plot with the transformed variables.
Lim,A possible improvement to our model to address the deviation from normality would be to have outliers removed from the data (4).
RQDef,Our final research question is to investigate whether the forum in which a thread is posted affects the view count.
Struct,"The plots on the diagonal show the marginal distribution of the key variables, which is similar to the histograms in figure 1"
Struct,Below is the corresponding regression equation and the correlation coefficient.
Context,"Big dating apps include Tinder, Hinged, and Bumble."
Data,"The vast majority of the animals in the AnAge dataset have a relatively low lifespan, which indicates our sponsor's quest for immortality faces some serious obstacles."
Data,The original distribution of deaths per day plotted above is unimodal and visually symmetric about its mean of approximately 115
Data,"The median of playing time for goalkeepers is higher than the median for other positions, but goalkeepers did have the lowest average playing time."
MethJust,"The reason is because the heat wave, while hot and potentially dangerous, was primarily due to societal-political issues."
MethJust,"An ANOVA F-test confirms that the sample populations of summer log-deaths are lower than winter log-deaths with a p-value of approximately 0 and an F-statistic of 989.6 (while removing outliers, discussed momentarily)"
Lim,"Looking at the data and our analysis, I believe a larger sample size would have given us a better and more precise understanding of the relationship between our key variables."
Context,This can help content creators understand which countries are the best to upload from if aiming to gain the highest views.
MethDef,We also used bootstrapping to make a 95% pivotal confidence interval for the mean number of deaths.
Lim,"Although the data was taken from a sufficiently large population, the data was not randomly sampled and not all expected cell counts were at least 5."
RQDef,It is reasonable to assume that videos with different kinds of content will get different kinds of views.
MethJust,"Second, the population must be at least 20 times as large as the sample."
Res,"We observe that the lifespan changed from 19 to 21.34173 years, difference of 2.34173 years."
Data,"The database includes variables such as lifespan, age of sexual maturity, adult body mass, metabolic rate, and typical body temperature (2)."
Data,"The most popular category is entertainment (517 out of the 1259 Youtubers sampled had a category of entertainment, making up 41% of the total sample) and Sports was the least popular (23 out of 1259 had sports as their category, making up only 2% of the sample)."
MethDef,We could do so by building a linear model and then working from there.
Data,"Views is not measured by every person who watched it, but by how many times that video was viewed."
Data,"The mean is 4460 videos, with a standard deviation of 13608."
Data,"Additionally, we see majority of the points fall in the range of 0 W/g and 0.01 W/g."
Context,Different countries have different populations and different global reaches.
Data,"Forth, the correlations among the covariates are non-zero and some of them are significant, suggesting the covariates are not independent."
Context,"Overall, this might allow us to estimate potential insurance premiums and how to lower those insurance premiums."
Res,"(5) We constructed a 95% confidence interval on this prediction which was [105.4345, 112.3879], that is to say there is significant evidence to support our prediction that under these specific conditions, the death rate falls within the interval [105.4345, 112.3879] given the assumptions and limitations of the model, which we assume only fails less than 5% of the time, and as our value falls within the interval, we can say it is likely to be accurate."
Res,Our model suggests that an increase in the $SO_2$ level is associated with a decrease in mortality.
MethJust,"As for the center, one of the best ways to measure central tendencies would be to use the mean."
MethJust,"The lagged GAM also has a lower standard error than the non-lagged GAM, with a difference of 0.652"
Data,"The research question, as stated in the next section, is focusing on Category, Country, and Subscribers."
Int,"Therefore, to answer Preston Jorgensen's question, animals with lower metabolic rates have longer lifespans (1)."
MethJust,So the use of ANOVA is justified.
Struct,"Below in Table 1, we show the MSE for the linear model and all of the spline models with ten-fold cross validation."
MethDef,H0: There is no association between drinking and body type (p > .05).
Lim,"(4)(6) Since residuals are not indepedent of the feature, which invalidates tests that assume that models have constant variance, we need to improve our model by fixing heteroskedasticity."
Context,"Thousands of people receive liver transplants every year, with 8,000 patients receiving the procedure in 2017 alone."
MethDef,We found a Poisson generalized additive model of the 7 day averages is the most representative model of this relationship.
Res,"In general, we found that most forest fires occur in August and September, but the reason behind this finding is not clear."
Lim,"Also, the data can look into what cause the fraud category to have more damages than others and what cause many plaintiffs received 0 dollars in remedy."
Res,"After applying transformations to the variables, we were able to find a more linear relationship between the two."
RQDef,Our first question will be to analyze if there is any association or correlation between a soccer player’s position and the amount of playtime they receive within a professional season.
Res,"Combining our results, we are confident that our true estimate of non-accidental deaths for a 70-degree day is between 105 and 110"
RQDef,Our third hypothesis considers the relationship between drug usage and relationship status.
Res,"The regression line has an y-intercept of approximately 11.86ha and a slope of 0.1149, which denotes a rather mild positive relationship between the two variables."
MethJust,"Thus, the lower $R^2$ may actually be hiding the fact that 'Metabolic.by.mass.log' and these other variables are linearly related, and we should focus on using it alone to avoid any multicollinearity issues further one."
Data,This is what is causing the median (orange dashed line) to deviate left very slightly from the mean (blue dashed line)
Res,"After performing the test, we get a test statistic of F = 1.9935 and a p-value = 0.0931."
Data,"When we look at the histograms, in Figure 1, almost all of them appear to be unimodal and skewed to the left."
RQDef,From this data we may suggest that lack of drug use attributes to an income at or higher than the median of all salaries.
RQDef,"With this in mind, we will look into each pollutant in more detail and determine the pollutant that appears to be most associated with mortality."
MethJust,"Also, we can use the ANOVA test in this case because since the group sizes( number of players at each position) are relatively large, i.e., greater than 30, with the smallest group size being 36."
Data,The 4 variables start with 'lag_' are the 7-day averages of the original variables.
Lim,"In Figure 7, the residuals seem to violate the gaussian noise assumption because the two tails deviate from the qq line."
Data,The Metabolic.by.mass (metabolic rate/mass) variable we created is strongly right skewed and unimodal (2) .
Data,Music is a far second and the rest of the topics have roughly the same amount of channels.
Int,"(This could be partly due to individual channels having the high majority of sports news and entertainment content, which makes the barriers of entry extraordinarily high.)."
Lim,"This removal eliminated around 20% of the data, which might have biased our results to those observations without missing columns, especially if the levels of pollutants were related to the missing data."
RQDef,"We will first analyze total passes by each of the positions played, and this analysis is shown in the table below."
Res,"Among these pollutants, ozone is most strongly associated to mortality."
MethJust,"After both transformations, there seems to be a moderately strong, negative, linear correlation between metabolic rate per unit body mass and lifespan of a species, as can be seen in figure 8."
Lim,"Because of this, our data may be a bit inaccurate."
Int,"A global goodness-of-fit test of my model, or an Chi-Square test reveals that there is not enough evidence to reject our lagged variable model."
Int,"In context, this means we do not find sufficient evidence that the average playtime of players in the 2010 world cup is less than 200 minutes."
Struct,Figure 3 displays a boxplot showing the title length of different channels.
MethJust,"Figure 2 is a distribution of the log-applied response variable, death - compared to the previous figure, the distribution seems much more normal, which validates our choice for a log transformation."
Res,"Further reviewing the Channel Categories, it can be seen that the top 4 categories make up 76.7% of the total of all of the channels in our sample size: this means that the five fewest amount of categories make up 23.31% or, on average, 4.66% each."
RQJust,"If there is a high amount of water vapor in the air, then we assume there is a relatively-larger amount of water in the surrounding vegetation."
Int,This would mean that if we would be 95% confident that a raccoon with its metabolic rate reduced by 50% would have an average lifespan between 19.05 years and 23.78 years.
Res,"Also, all claims except rental/lease have a boxplot that is comparatively long."
Res,Africa seems to have the least and the Americas seem to have the greatest number of subscribers.
MethDef,"First, we construct a simple linear regression model, called Model 1, which uses $Metabolic.log$ to predict $Age.log$."
MethDef,Alternate Hypothesis (HA): At Least one Mean not Equal.
MethDef,"We first conduct a global chi-squared goodness-of-fit test of our model 2, which uses the average of the temperature and pollution variables as predictors of death rate."
MethJust,"Since we have justified the reasonable linearity of the data, we now will turn to the formal significance test for the regression slope."
MethJust,The pairs plot in combination with our univarate data analysis leads us to believe that there are transformations we should do before modeling our data (4).
Struct,"As done in the previous hypotheses, we want to compare our variables visually."
Context,"In the 21st century, it fair to say that with enough money you can buy you almost anything."
MethJust,"From Figure 2 and 3, we observed that the relationship between death and each covariate is nonlinear but does not deviate too much from a linear trend, so the smoothing spline will fit well with few effective degrees of freedom (edf) required."
Int,"However, we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that reducing air pollution will lead to a decrease in mortality (3)"
Data,"Lag_pm10median has a minimum of -24.1192, maximum of 56.0811, median of -1.6828, mean of -0.0243, and standard deviation of 10.2995"
MethDef,Model1 uses covariates that are not 'lagged' and model2 only inlcudes covariates with 'lagged' term.
Data,Other variables involved in the research scenarios are age and duration of stay.
Int,It is surprising that account longevity has no bearing on this measure of success but does have a relationship to number of subscribers.
Res,"The Americas and Oceania seem to have a bigger median, while Africa has a smaller median."
Data,The boxplot visualizes that there is a single outlier of an extremely cold day in chicago (apporximately -15 degrees) and it shows that temperature is roughly centered about 50 degrees farenheit.
Data,The distribution of area as shown in figure 1 is unimodal with the mode occurring between 0 and 9.99.
RQJust,"Due to our common knowledge that it is easier for forest fires to expand in dry condition, it is reasonable to assume that there is a negative relationship between RH and area."
MethJust,It well navigates the curvature of the data and has the piecewise linear structure you would expect looking at a scatterplot.
Context,"While these resources are very useful, the internet is oversaturated with discussion forums and posts."
Res,The majority of plaintiffs received damages that are less than 100000 dollars and many of them received 0 dollars.
RQDef,We hypothesize that there will be a relationship between sex and drinking habits.
Data,"Looking at the correlations of log_death with the predictors, we observe that the response variable has a notable negative correlation with temperature of -0.39"
Res,We find that a decrease in the level of ozone and $PM_{10}$ is generally associated with lower mortality in Chicago.
Int,"Essentially, lowering metabolic rate does not neccessarily directly increase lifespan."
Data,(5) An interesting trend in the data is that the lagged versions of the predictor variables appear to be more stable than the non-lagged versions.
Int,"The vast majority of recorded wildfires are under 10 hectares (over 82%), and it appears that it is very common for small fires to start and then stop before burning any significant amount of land."
Context,"Youtube, a popular video-sharing platform, is one of the many ways in which members of our ever-growing society share and view content."
Data,"Midfielder and defender positions seem to have the highest mean playing time, whereas forwards seem to have a little lower of a playing time and goalkeepers have an extremely low playing time."
Int,A final explanation is that the majority of recorded flames are under 0.1 hectares due to the precision of data recording and the high likelihood that small fires occur frequently.Our initial hypothesis — that most fires are of medium size — is contradicted by the data analyzed.
Data,"(1) To help answer these questions, we are using a subset of air quality measurements in Chicago, Illinois from January 1987 to December 2000"
MethJust,"We also find that the p-value of Beta 1 is very small and the adjusted r-squared value is 0.3401, showing the fit is reasonable."
Struct,"In order to use the one-way ANOVA test, we have to make sure of several things first."
Data,"Our boxplot shows another right-skew distribution, and outliers again to the right end."
Lim,"Fifth, currently we only use data from Chicago, but we may need to include data from other places to make our conclusion more generalized."
Data,There are 1054 missing datapoints.
Lim,"For example, herbivore animals may tend to have lower metabolic rates and longer lifespans than carnivore animals, which resulted in the negative relationship between lifespan and the metabolic rate we see in our model."
MethDef,We will use splines to construct 5 models to predict $Age.log$ by $Metabolic.log$..
Context,"Many believe the world around us is dying, as major events such as mass extinction and climate changed are fueled by an increasingly toxic world."
RQDef,Our third question will be to understand the views per videos based on the country the video is uploaded from.
Res,The slope for the ozone curve seems to be the largest.
Res,"As shown in figure x, the number of views on a channel increases as the number of subscribers increases."
Res,"Finally, the interquartile range also provides us insight as the 25th percentile of 368,129 and the 75th percentile of 2,622,046 explains how only 25% of the channels exceeded the 75th percentile, averaging over 2.6M views per video count."
MethDef,"Instead we can use our resampling of residuals bootstrap method, as that would be more appropriate in this situation."
Data,"Data was collected by a python script software, which drew data from active profiles during June of 2012 if the profile had at least one profile picture."
MethDef,"Since we're also planning on exploring the association between death and air quality/temperature metrics across multiple days, we will create a correlation matrix with our lagged covariates and our response variable, 'death'"
Res,This relationship appears to be relatively constant except for animals with log metabolic rates between -8 and -7.
Lim,In fact there was not enough data in a dating profile to even answer that specific a question.
Data,"Our research analysis concentrated on the qualitative variable Category for a sample of 1259 YouTube Channels, examining relationships (if any) with subscribers and views."
Res,"At the same time, we can also tell that apart from the United States, India, and Great Britain all other countries’ representation seems to be fairly small."
Res,"After performing our ANOVA test, we see that our F Score is 25.4228 and our p-value is approximately 0."
MethJust,The fact that the two CI's are highly similar suggests that the outliers we see in figure 4 do not constitute major violations to assumptions of our model (7)
Res,The formula here is: Y=89.77+14.33X (round to two decimals place).
MethJust,"For this model, as we have noticed that the variance of residuals depends on the explanatory variable Metabolic.log, re-sample cases (non-parametric bootstrap) would be the most appropriate method to use when we want to calculate relevant statistic's (6)."
Struct,Now we use the data we have collected to create a model for inference.
Lim,"As discussed above, our model does not control for all potential confounding variables, which means that casual analysis drawn using our model could be invalid (3)"
Lim,"Although we chose to use smoothing splines for each covariate in our original models, a simple plot of each of the terms shows that some of the terms might have been linear and did not require a smoothing spline."
MethJust,"However, we have to stick with model B due to the limit of computing power we have."
MethDef,"In regard to the other 5 models, since one of the goals of our analysis is to understand the linearity of the relationship between maxixum longevity and metabolic rate, we will apply 5 non parametric smoothed spline models at degrees of freedom 3 - 7."
Int,"Through a 95% pivotal confidence interval of 18.57 to 22.98 years, we concluded that this reduction in the pet's metabolic rate would not yield a change to its lifespan since its original lifespan of 19 years is within this confidence interval (2)."
Int,"It is possible that, after reducing pollution, the mean of deaths is still higher than the actual mean."
Data,'Body.mass.g' : The typical adult body mass in grams.
Lim,"(3) While this relationship is potentially skewed by the time of year, we maintain this claim and suggest more analysis should be run, holding time or seasonality constant."
Struct,"However, we must realize that there are constraints to these conclusions."
Data,"When calculated across all channels, the mean was 2,960,682 views per video with a standard deviation of 8,332,162 as displayed in the figure below."
RQDef,"Let muS, muSS, muA, muM denote the average age of the users who are single, seeing someone, available, or are married."
Res,"However, when analyzing the data, we find that 82.42% (422/512) of all recorded fires have an area variable of below 10, while there are only a few outliers with large values for the area."
Res,Thus number of forest fires in Summer does not exceed half of the number in one year.
RQDef,This research question deals with how the origin country of a youtube account effects thee viewsPerVideo.
Struct,"Before we start developing models, this section will provide insight on the key variables we will be examining in this paper."
Int,"In summary, the data does support our hypothesis since there is a linear increase in the proportion of subscriber count relative to account age."
Data,The data contains several air quality measurements in Chicago from January 1987 to December 2000 with death rate of each day.
Context,"Overall, our analysis can help individuals who plan to start a career in the youtube world, obtain a small advantage, and entertain as many people as possible."
MethDef,"Next in our modeling analysis, we will determine which of these six models best fit the data by calculating each model’s prediction error using cross-validation techniques."
Lim,"Therefore, it is hard to extrapolate meaningful conclusion from region specific research to globally."
MethJust,The trend line appears to capture the shape of the relationship between the two variables well without overfitting.
RQDef,"In simpler terms, does the pollution amount on a certain day affect the death rate only on that day or over time."
MethJust,"This is because global warming effects are becoming more and more pronounced each year, and we can expect similar events more often."
MethDef,This gives us evidence that choosing the spline model as our selected model may be more promising than sticking with simple linear regression.
Int,"We can conclude that the more posts a thread has, the more views it will generally have."
RQJust,"We can see that most patients with a PatientMDRB score of 1, indicating that they had an MDRB infection within a year of the transplant, had a severity score of at least 15, while half of patients with PatientMDRB of 0, indicating no MDRB infection in a year, had a severity score of less than 16."
Res,"To summarize our findings about the association between atmospheric pollutants and mortality, we have discovered that there is indeed a relationship between our air pollutant variables and mortality."
Int,"Overall, it can be seen through a comparison of the mean viewsPerVideo and country as well as through the median and the country, that there is not enough evidence to determine a relationship."
Res,"(1) According to Figure 6, it seems that animals with lower metabolic rates have longer lifespans, as requested by Preston Jorgensen."
Lim,We would highly recommend that Preston Jorgensen speak to his physician about the risks of pollution because all of the data is from the same city so it is not great for us to make assumptions about pollution and mortality.
Data,The log-transformed death histogram displays a normal distribution centered at 4.7 with a few outliers at high log(death) values (2)
MethJust,The linear model had an estimated MSE of prediction error equal to .364156.
RQDef,Our next research question is to look into whether mean total passes of players is associated with the position of the player.
Struct,"Figure 10 shows the plot of the residuals for the linear model, and figure 11 shows the QQ-plot of those residuals."
Res,"Overall, we found that the majority of players attempted less than 3 shots."
Lim,"Thus, we cannot assume pollution directly affects death rate, but rather observe that there appears to be a relationship between pollutant levels and mortality rate."
Data,Some users preferred not to indicate their drug usage.
Context,"Preston Jorgensen, a billionaire looking to become immortal, is interested in knowing what factors appear to be related to lifespan."
Data,"The boxplot and histogram seem to show that there is a normal distribution with not a big spread for the average, and that there are some outliers far out to the right."
Lim,It is possible that we fail to see a significant difference because our test is not powerful enough (3)
Int,"The p-value is smaller than any reasonable significance level, so we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is sufficient evidence that the average number of attempted shots varies by the position played."
Res,"Third, for an animal having similar body mass and metabolic rate with the crab-eating raccoon, if its metabolic were 50% smaller, my model will predict its mean lifespan to be between 18.33647 years and 22.70744 years."
Data,"Our subset of data contains 4,012 observations of air quality, temperature, and non-accidental death measurements in Chicago from 1987 to 2000"

Context,"The findings may be helpful to coaches and teams around the world, looking to become the next world champions or just to win their next match."
RQDef,"(1) In this study, we are interested in determining whether a relationship exists between metabolic rate and lifespan, and if so, would a linear relationship or a nonlinear fit be the best to characterize the relationship."
Int,"However, we are not confident to conclude that this effect is definitely larger than the pollution's instantaneous effect."
Context,"In professional leagues, variable statistics are recorded on players to determine how skilled they are and how well they do within a certain league."
MethJust,"PM10 pollution shows some outliers, it appears, but this is consistent with its distribution."
Data,(3) Figures 12 shows possibly a slightly negative correlation between ozone concentration and logarithmic death rate.
Context,Money can buy almost anything in this world.
Int,"Because this interval contains 19 years, I do not have sufficient evidence to say that the lifespan will be different for a raccoon with 50% slower metabolic rate."
Int,"Since neither of our variables are randomly assigned but instead an observed value for each sample stool, we cannot conclude that there is causation."
MethDef,"We use the third model from the EDA transformation part, which had both variables log transformed."
Context,"Overall, the analysis helps people to realize the uneven distribution of damages among plaintiffs and whether the amount of damages they demanded may affect the judge’s decision."
Lim,A biologist should possibly be consulted for this.
Int,"Around this time there was an extreme heat wave in Chicago, which contributed to the higher-than-usual number of deaths."
MethDef,"Therefore, since this event is not appropriately explained by the variables in our data we decided to remove the event from our dataset."
Int,"(2) However, this should not immediately push Mr Jorgenson to conclude that reducing the crab-eating racoon's metabolic rate by 50% would cause its lifespan to change, since we have only observational data, and not experimental data."
Struct,"We examine the univariate distributions for our predictor variables Body.mass.g, Maximum.longevity.yrs, and Temperature."
Int,"This is interesting given the positive association we found between lag-ozone and lag-temperature, but this deviation from our previous intuition gives us confidence in lag-ozone's relationship with log-deaths, our response."
MethJust,"In order to best look at the shape, center, and spread of the data for DMC, I’ve created a histogram with the given data so that it’s easier to visualize."
Int,"Given that the mean number of deaths was found to be 115 deaths and is contained within both the predict function and pivotal bootstrap confidence intervals, I would say that reducing pollution to the lowest pollutant values would not significantly reduce death rate."
Data,Position is a categorical variable that shows the main position for a certain player.
Context,"Therefore, examining whether sex and education have a relationship is subject of interest."
Int,"But in general, it also indicates that there are large variations in the amount of damages that cause the data to be widely distributed."
Res,"It can also be observed that although there are fewer fires in September, their severity appears to be greater, as the total area burned is larger."
MethJust,"However, compared to the estimated standard errors, the difference in the cross validation errors is not extremely significant, with that of Model 2 being slightly lower."
RQJust,This is because conditions during summer appear to be more conducive to wildfires — hotter and drier days — and vice versa for winter.
Data,"The distribution is approximately normal, but the ""center"" is rather wide and almost bimodal, as opposed to one even hump"
Lim,"It is possible that adding a quadratic term may improve the spread and the normality of the residuals, as we did notice earlier a possible underlying curve in the relationship between lifespan and metabolic rate by unit body mass for species."
Int,"Under the prior assumption, we could also say that holding $Class$, $Body.mass.g$, and $Temperature$ constant, decrease metabolic rate by 1% increase maximum lifespan by 0.1851%."
RQDef,Our goal in this study is to understand and determine which factors play a role in scoring points in matches.
MethDef,"(6) Since the residuals appear not to depend on the value of the predictor and we are confident in the general correctness of the model, resampling residuals appears to be a fine solution for bootstrapping, and resampling cases is not necessary."
MethJust,"We choose to fit based off of only 'Metabolic.by.mass.log' because from the EDA, this variable had a decently strong enough correlation with the other variables so we should be cautious and only select this one variable to fit with our models in order to avoid any multicollinearity issues."
Data,"Sulfur dioxide and PM10, however, show a somewhat positive association that increases in variance with increased values of both variables."
Int,"For the modelling we conducted in the previous section, it is apparent that the effect of pollutants on morality is not instantaneous, but rather extends over time."
Int,"Therefore, we inferred that O3 is the most associated factor for death(4)"
Context,The number of subscribers that a specific category has can prove to be important in the context of which categories are best to enter as a new content creator(The categories that have the most subscribers should lead to a quicker pace of increasing subscriber count).
Res,"Since the views per video range from around 4,500 (the lowest minimum is around 4,500 views, Derived from Figure 1) is to 211 million, it is safe to say the average views per video for Music and Entertainment are fairly close."
Res,"Also, we noticed that very low levels of ozone are associated with an increase in mortality, which is worth further study (1)"
Data,"The data include potential explanatory variables such as number of non-accidental death each day, the median density of PM10 pollution(mg/m^3) which is a particle with diameter less than 10 micrometers, the median concentration of ozone(parts per billion), median concentration of sulfur dioxide, and the mean temperature of the day(Fahrenheit)"
MethDef,"To do so, we fit a poisson GAM that only includes the lagged temperature as its feature (Model 3) to compare it against our full lagged GAM with the pollutants and temperature as its features (Model 2) using a hypothesis test."
Int,"Though we found that certain pollutants are associated with an increase in mortality, we cannot conclude a causal effect between reducing pollutants and decreasing mortality."
MethJust,We decided to use the second model for the rest of our analyses because the mean prediction error was slightly smaller.

Context,We have observed higher death rates in areas with higher levels of air pollution.
MethJust,"(3) However, it is worth noting that the difference between the models does not appear significant, based on the uncertainty in your estimates of the prediction error."
Res,"Similarly, the p-value of the slope is reported to be less than 2x$10^{-16}$, which also indicates a significant, negative relationship between the two."
Int,"In Modeling section, we discussed that MSE of model2, which uses lagged variables, is better than model1 although the difference is minimal(3)"
Data,"Also, it appears that $so2$ is strongly correlated with $tmpd$ (correlation coefficient 0.542), which suggests that our models might suffer from multicollinearity (5)"
Struct,The assumptions of Model B are checked in 4.5
RQDef,This research questions explores if there is a significant relationship between drug use and physical well-being.
Struct,"We will start by looking at the distribution of our response variable, Maximum Longevity."
Int,"Under the assumption that there are no more confounding variables except for $Class$, $Body.mass.g$, and $Temperature$, we can claim that reducing the metabolic rate of a crab-eating raccoon would lead to 1.9 years increase in its maximum life expectancy (2)."
Data,"In addition, we noticed that there are many NA's in the data."
RQDef,"Since a more diverse intestine is better at fighting off disease, it is reasonable to assume that a higher diversity will lead to reduced chances of MDRB being present."
Data,"To make our work clearer, we split the covatiates into two groups: not lagged variables ('pm10median', 'o3median', 'so2median', 'tmpd') and lagged variables ('lag_pm10median', 'lag_o3median', 'lag_so2median', 'lag_tmpd')"
Struct,"Table 1 demonstrates the median, mean, min, and max value for each predictor."
Context,"One company, Mashable, a digital media website, has begun seeing what characteristics are related to their dissemination online."
Lim,"(5) However it is important to note that all the spline models are quite close to each other in mean squared error in context of the standard deviations output below, so it could be that another spline model is truly the best option."
Data,"The original data was a volunteered sample that consisted of 59946 users within a 25 mile radius of San Francisco, who had active accounts on 06/06/2012."
Data,The primary response variable is death which is defined as the number of non-accidental deaths on that date.

Data,"Similarly, there is a positive correlation between 'pm10median' and 'tmpd', with coefficient 0.359"
Data,Our research questions will primarily be focused on the quantitative variable Duff Moisture Code (DMC) and it’s relationship with DC (Drought Code).
Data,The histogram visualizes the distribution of this variable as being skewed right without a normal distribution while the boxplot clearly shows 7 outliers comprised of animals with large lifespans ranging from about 45 to nearly 125 years (3).
MethDef,"In order to determine the most accurate regression model for the data, we will begin by constructing a simple linear model which predicts the square root of the lifespan of a species from the square root of their metabolic rate per unit body mass to try to model the relationship between the two variables."
Int,"It is then determined by significance test that we have enough evidence of an upward, positive slope between posts and views."
MethJust,"The relationship between our unscaled death variable and time is the same as with the log-scaled version, but using the log-scaled response is helpful in making modeling decisions."
RQJust,"(1) Among the pollutants, 'lag_o3median' has the highest correlation, so we would expect it is most strongly associated with mortality."
Data,"Also, there are 27 data points with no value for so2median."
Struct,We have to notice that there are many limitations to this analysis that might affect the conclusions.
Int,"Logically, this makes sense because the impact of air quality and unusual temperatures can compound on the human body as it prolongs."
RQJust,"When we run ANOVA, the test outputs a test statistic of F= 15.7301, with a corresponding p value of 0."
Data,"Looking closer at our response variable, 'death', we can see that the range of values is quite large, from 69 to 411 non-accidental deaths for different observations."
Lim,A future analysis should most likely consider an accounts age to determine whether or not longer existing accounts tend to get more viewsPerVideo in comparison to newer accounts.
Int,"Although we discovered that the decrease in air pollution is associated with lower mortality, we cannot conclude whether reducing pollution will lead to a decrease in mortality (2)"

Struct,"We also plotted a histogram of our response variable, Lifespan (Figure 2)."
RQDef,"Lastly, using our model on metabolic rate and lifespan we want to be able to estimate what the mean lifespan of animal with characteristics of crab-eating racoon with a 50% smaller metabolic rate than normal."
Res,"While setting lag-temperature to 70 degrees fahrenheit, we also find when the average number of deaths (same for log-deaths) is lowest for both month and year given that it is summer (a likely case for a 70 degree day), which corresponds to August and the year 1998"
Int,"This is consistent with the weather condition in Chicago, where extreme cold climates lead to massive death much more often compared to extremely hot weather."
Data,"The predictor variables appear to have significant non-zero correlations with each other, with the positive association between 'temperature' and $O_3$ being the largest, followed by the positive association between $SO_2$ and $PM_{10}$"
Int,"However, our bootstrapped 95% confidence interval included the lifespan of the raccoon with a normal metabolic rate, so we cannot conclude that reducing the metabolic rate would definitively increase the lifespan (2)."
Res,"The prediction outcome was 109.51, and the 95% confidence interval for this value was (106.49, 113.13)"
Data,The variable position is a categorical variable that indicates a player’s position on the field.
MethJust,"The log-transform seems to better our analysis, so we moving forward with our modelling and diagnostics we will continue to keep this transformation."

MethJust,"After the transformation, the distribution is not skewed."
Context,"This study can be used by SFN, to understand what makes threads worth visiting so they can enhance how they promote such threads and increase online engagement."
RQDef,"To answer Jorgensen's last question, we made a prediction for the mean number of deaths and its confidence interval assuming the pollution variables were at their smallest values, on a 70-degree farenheit day."
Data,"The dataset we use contains the measurements of air quality in Chicago, Illinois each day from January 1987 to the end of December 2000"
Data,"We can also see that post log-transformation, that there appears to be a negative and maybe linear relationship between Metabolic Rate and Longevity."
Lim,By comparing this estimate generally to a prediction of expected deaths over all our months may lead to potentially skewed results due to seasonally dependent relationships with our response.
Res,"After creating the generalized additive model, we analyzed the model by obtaining a confidence interval of the mean number of deaths on a 70-degree day with the lowest pollutant values and found that reducing pollutant values to the lowest level seems to be associated with little to no change in death rate (3)"
Struct,"From the correlation plots in Figure 4, we can determine the correlations between our covariates and our non-lagged response variables."
Int,"If Mr. Jorgensen pays for research to reduce the levels of $PM_{10}$, $O_3$, and $SO_2$ to the lowest they've been historically, he can reasonably expect the number of non-accidental deaths to be approximately 109 deaths or within 106 to 112 deaths."
RQDef,"Overall, this suggests that there is a relationship between playtime and a player’s position."
Res,"If each pollution variable is at its smallest value observed, then the estimated mean number of deaths on a 70-degree day will be 106.1945 with a 95% confidence interval between 99.75592 and 113.31885"
MethJust,"Although the prediction error difference and model 2 standard error are relatively close and depend on the set of random folds we select, based on our random fold we can confidently say that our lagged model (model 2) is a better fit to the data than our un-lagged model (model 1)"
RQJust,"Since entertainment has already been proven to be the most viewed video category, we hypothesize that the greatest amount of channels appears within the entertainment category as well."
MethDef,"Given that Preston Jorgenson wants to identify the relationship between the three pollutants and mortality rate and the pollutant with the strongest relationship with death rate, our final models will continue to use pm10median, o3median, so2median, and tmpd and be used to answer the three primary questions."
Int,These clusters may be useful to pay attention to and remember later on when we move on to the Modeling part of our report.

Data,"Note, the lagged covariates represent the 7-day averages of the original variables and will be used to determine whether the effect of pollution is instantenous or extends over time."
Res,"Under $alpha=0.05$ significance level, our p-value of 7.00e-15 indicates we have significant evidence to assume the deviance is non-zero, which means we can ""reject"" our reduced model"
Res,"Further, it can be seen that the plot has a right skew."
Data,The distribution of duration of stay is right-skewed with a multimodal distribution.
Int,This may help coaches understand that more playing time for their players may bring more passes amongst the team.
Data,Each year their levels have peaks and valleys which is expected due to the different seasons.
RQDef,"That is to say, in this study we are interested in discovering if there is evidence to support this theorized positive relationship between pollution and mortality, and, if so, is this effect instantaneous or extending over time."
Res,We see that the entertainment category does not have the greatest mean or median.
Data,"“Never” was chosen the most, “sometimes” was second most, and “often” was chosen the least."
Data,It is important to note that 7-day averages of the original variables are also given.
MethDef,"Our model so far also considers 'lag_temperature' as a covariate, which means the impact of temperature is factored into our lagged GAM"
MethJust,"From the residuals vs fitted plot, it seems that in terms of the linear model assumptions, linearity seems to hold since residuals center around 0 for each fitted values."
Lim,"While our model fits reasonably well, there is still room for improvement."
MethJust,"After applying the log transformation to our response and predictor variables, we saw clear improvment in the shape of the histogram and normality of the distribution of both maximum.longevity.yrs and metabolic.by.mass as neither histogram is still strongly right skewed."

Res,There is a clear growth in views alongside posts.
Data,"Overall, the number of deaths in this plot over time reveal a bit of an up and down pattern, or sinusoidal (3)"
Res,"As our pValue is far greater than 0.05, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis."
MethJust,"Although the difference between the models do not appear too significant, based on the uncertainty in our estimates of the prediction error, with a differnce of around 14, the model we will choose for our results will be the model with lagged variables based on prediction errors (3)"
MethJust,"According to Figure 5, the estimated prediction MSEs of different models vary by less than 0.016."
RQJust,These differences in proportion informally suggest a relationship between sex and drug habits.
RQJust,"Notably, the presence of ozone and particulate matter pollutants appears to be stronger in higher temperatures, indicating that these pollutants are likely to be in higher concentrations during warmer temperatures, such as in the summer."

RQDef,We will dive into three questions: Is there evidence that these pollutants are associated with increased mortality.
Res,"(5) Upon bootstrapping the data, we get a new confidence interval of roughly [107, 110] (6)"

Struct,There were some limitations with the data during this analysis.
Int,"The variables that are most associated with deaths in Chicago, however, appear to be time and temperature."
Context,"Overall, our analyses provide great insight into not just our research questions, but future research that can find useful relationships between drug use and other important factors of life, like income and substance usage."
MethDef,We computed a 95 % pivotal confidence interval (CI) for the prior prediction via bootstrapping.
Res,"We found that some pollutants have a stronger association, the ozone concentration and the sulfur dioxide concentration, with the mortality rate and an increase in these pollutants are associated with an increase in non-accidental deaths."
RQDef,"Above all, we examined the relationship between Metabolic Rate by Mass and lifespan of animal species to answer the questions addressed earlier."
Lim,"Some limitations to our analysis that might have affected our outcome might be the observations that we removed at the start, due to missing data."
RQDef,Our third research question is whether there is a relationship between patient diagnosis and whether the patient had an MDRB infection within a year of the transplant.
Int,"With our model, (3) we are concluding that metabolic rate does have an inverse significant impact on lifespan: the lower the unit metabolic rate, the higher the maximum lifespan in years."
MethJust,"(5) Looking at the MSE between the models, the MSE difference between the models does not seem very significant, especially between the smooth spline models of different df."
MethJust,"As a result, the deviance explained in model1 is 19.8% which is lower than that of model2, 25.9%"
RQDef,"Our analysis focused on the viewsPerVideo within a sample of 1259 Youtubers to determine if a relationship between their category, country of origin, and subscriber count and viewsPerVideo."
MethJust,"In Figure 6, we see that the residuals appear to be randomly distributed and centered around the 0-line with constant variance."
Data,Data generated from the histogram in Table 1 shows that the average age is close to 33 years old with a standard deviation of almost 10 years.
Data,Further summarization of the data shows 64% of all OKCupid users “never” used drugs while only 1.3% “often” use drugs.
Context,Should Jorgensen spend his fortune to reduce pollution.
Int,"Furthermore, as stated before, this study is based on observational data which means we can't conclude decreasing pollutants will lead to decrease in mortality rate."
MethDef,"It is important to note that s() indicates the nonlinear spline smoothing function (with different effective degrees of freedom, from 3 to 7, for each spline model) (2)."
RQDef,"However, first we have to see if there is a relationship between sex and income."
Struct,This should be the priority for investigation as we move forward.
Int,"Therefore, we got a narrower confidence interval."
Data,"We have a total of 6 key variables: time, death, pm10median, o3median, so2median, and tmpd."
MethDef,"We can do a hypothesis testing to check whether 'Temperature' is a confounding variable, with null hypothesis $beta_2 = 0$ for the slope coefficient for 'Temperature' and alternative hypothesis $beta_2 neq 0$."
Res,After transforming the data we observed a negative linear relationship.
Struct,We begin by performing some data transformation.
Data,"The continent where the YouTube channel is registered, which is a categorical variable."
Res,"Our results indicated an association exists between pollutants and mortality, with $O_3$ appearing to have the strongest association with 'death', followed by $PM_{10}$"
Data,A lag-variable observation is the average of observations 6 days prior and including the day (an average of 7 days)
Struct,This is a bar chart showing the age of OkCupid users and the frequency of each age.
MethDef,"After assumptions have been met, we can perform the two-sample proportion test."
MethDef,The models that we use can be found below: Original generalized additive model: _log(death)_ ~ _s(pm10median)_ + _s(o3median)_ + _s(so2median)_ + _s(tmpd)_ Lagged generalized additive model: _log(death)_ ~ _s(lag_pm10median)_ + _s(lag_o3median)_ + _s(lag_so2median)_ + _s(lag_tmpd)_
MethJust,(5) The differences between the largest mean squared error of models and the smallest mean squared error for the spline models are smaller than the differences between the standard errors.
RQJust,"It seems from the data that people who don’t use drugs use drinking as a substitute, whereas people who don’t drink don’t bother doing drugs as a substitute at all."
RQDef,"We first examined what the true mean playing time of majority of the players was, and then we examined the potential relationships between position and playing time, and position and total passes."
Data,"The outliers suggest that, perhaps, the important values are within closer to that 17 rather than 28"
Int,"Overall, we can conclude that diversity of a stool sample is related to the presence of MDRB in the sample, with a higher diversity making it less likely for a sample to have MDRB."
Data,"Looking at so2median, it is also unimodal with a right skewed distribution, and naturally the 7 day average variable, lag_so2median holds the same shape."
MethDef,"To evaluate whether or not these values should be included in our data, we looked for events in Chicago on the respective dates that would allow us to classify these values as abnormal, and are not explained by our given predictors, pollution variables and temperature."
Data,"From the pairs plot in Figure 3, it appears that our response variable has a negative and nonlinear relationship with our 'Metabolic.by.mass' variable."
Lim,A limitation to our study was that there was some conditions that were not able to be satisfied due to the grouping of our data.
MethDef,"To formally test the question of whether mean playtime differs by position, we will use ANOVA (analysis of variance)."
Int,"From our analysis, we have no evidence to conclude whether the effect of air pollution on mortality is instantaneous or does it propagates over time."
Data,All information was collected by Social Blade.
Int,Note there are some outliers towrads the right extreme end of temperature which seems to match with the ourliers around 1995 when scorch hit.
RQDef,"Lastly, we will use modeled estimate to find if crab-eating raccoon would be a good company during Preston's immortality with a 50% smaller metabolic rate (1)."
MethDef,"Our null model is regressed on the identical spline terms for lag-temperature, month and year used in our lag-model, described in the previous section."
MethJust,"We tried to use log transformation and square-root transformation on the skewed covariates, but it did not improve the fit of the data too much."
Res,"As for Mr.Preston Jorgensen, we discovered that if the average air pollution in the past 7 days is at a minimal level (in the historical record), and the average median temperature is 70 degrees Fahrenheit, the estimated mortality in Chicago will be about 107.25 people on 30 December 2000, on average (2)"
MethDef,"Regarding status, users that indicated “sometimes” and “often” are considered to be drug users."
Context,YouTube has become a video-sharing platform that billions turn to for all sorts of entertainment with videos that can garner billions of views and influencers with millions of subscribers.
Data,The other variables involved in answering the research questions are income and drug use.
Data,"The four positions include: Defender, Forward, Goalkeeper and Midfielder."
MethJust,"Furthermore, the estimated standard errors of the MSEs are very similar and small compared to the cross validation errors, meaning that our estimates for the cross validation errors are equally valid."
Int,"Additionally, we saw that the effect is not instantaneous, but over time, as our lagged model fit the data better than the non-lagged model (1)"
MethDef,We will assume initially (our null hypothesis) that there is no difference between our model using only temperature and our model using temperature and the pollutants.
RQDef,"We assume then by this reasoning, that because the Sports category is the least frequent out of all, it will also have the the least number of views."
RQDef,"Let muS, muSS, muA, muM denote the average height of the users who are single, seeing someone, available, or are married."
MethDef,We can carry out the test at level 0.05.
Data,The boxplot clearly visualizes several outliers that are both low values and high values of log of deaths.
Lim,"In processing data, we removed all observations that contain NA value."
Context,Forest fires are one such event that has cost governments billions of dollars in damages and severe loss of civilian life in recent memory.
Data,There are 6 missing datapoints.
MethJust,"Considering that 'death' is a count variable and our covariates don't appear to have a linear relationship with deaths, which we will cover further in this paper, it's most logical to use Poisson GAMs with the log link function for our dataset."
Data,"The primary variable that this report will be focusing on is age, which is a quantitative variable defined as the user’s age in years, as reported on their profile."
MethDef,"With the chosen spline model with degrees of freedom being 7, it seems like non-parametric bootstrapping is an appropriate choice since the method re-samples the original data and is also well-known for having no assumptions about the distribution of data it is being applied to (6)."
Res,The new rate given that is 50% smaller is 0.00111.
MethJust,"This makes sense intuitively, because one would think that multiple days in a row of poor air quality would affect one's lungs and health more than one random day of poor air quality."
MethJust,The error I get for the linear model is 0.3682643.
MethDef,"(2) Next, we will fit 5 different spline models with effective degrees of freedom between 3 and 7."
RQJust,"Since we have anecdotal/visual evidence that playtime is not a lot for most players, being less than 200 minutes, we well test the follow hypotheses."
MethJust,"If we first take a look at the linear model (shown in below figure 8), we can see it has a linear trend."
MethJust,"For smoothing splines with a closer MSE to Linear model, we see that mean +- sd are largely overlapping, which makes the difference less significant."
MethJust,"The respective standard deviations for severity in each group are 8.987 and 8.658, which are within a factor of 2 and therefore close enough."
Struct,The MSE and standard error estimated for each model after performing 5-fold cross-validation are shown below.
MethDef,"These two models are, $$ model1 : beta_0 + s(PM) + s(O3) + s(SO2) + S(temperature) $$ $$ model2 : beta_0 + s(lagPM) +s(lag O3) + s(lagSO2) + s(lag.temperature) $$"
RQJust,"Weather patterns and human activity, for example, are two factors that are closely related to the time of year.We will make the initial hypothesis that wildfires are more likely to occur and cause significantly more damage in the summer (June, July, August) months and are less likely to occur with less intensity during the winter (November, December, January) months."
Context,"Dating services are an important part of our culture, and can help us understand how gender and sex affect society."
Res,"The Entertainment histogram is heavily rightly skewed, most of the views lie in the 0 to 4 million views per video."
Data,"However, the relationship between them seems weak as suggested by the magnitude of the correlation coefficient."
MethDef,We thus appended '.log' to the end of each of the variables.
Struct,Above is the linear regression model table.
MethJust,"To demonstrate the magnitude of the range and outliers for data regarding this variable, the following is a box plot of the area."
Data,There seems to be a negative linear relationship between log(Lifespan) and log(Metabolic.by.mass) (6).
Int,This shows that the model fits well (1)
Int,"These conclusions seem to suggest that the population of dating sites are not necessarily young adults, and that there might be evidence that the older a person is, the less likely they are to do recreational drugs."
Data,"Originally, the mean lifespan of the raccoon without the reduction in metabolic rate is 19 years."
Data,"Likewise, PatientMDRB is a categorical variable with value 1 if there was an MDRB infection in a year and 0 if there wasn’t for the given patient."
Data,"As shown in Figure 4, 74.3% (1115/1500) of users are male and 25.7% (385/1500) are female."
MethDef,"To assess whether animals with lower metabolic rates have longer lifespans, we will use a 95% confidence interval to check if the true population coefficient of the slope of the linear regression is different from 0."
Struct,There are several limitations to this research mentioned in conclusion.
MethDef,"So we would build an addtive model, where each covariate is fitted with a smoothing spline."
Res,"From our analysis of the Crab-Eating Raccoon, our model predicts that halving the metabolic rate is correlated with an increase in the lifespan of the animal."
RQJust,"Further, Youtubers of the same country as a viewer are more relatable, thus making them more enticing to watch."
RQDef,"We will attempt first to predict lifespan based on metabolic rate (adjusted for animal mass), after which we will explore the linearity (or lack thereof) of the relationship, and finally attempt to determine whether reduction in the crab-eating racoon's metabolic rate would permit us to expand the expected lifespan of the racoon in order to provide Mr Jorgenson a longer-lived pet for his pursuit of immortality."
Data,When evaluating the different features we should also be cognizant that all of the animals which we are examining belong to the same Kingdom and Phylum.
RQDef,"On a deeper level, we want to know if there is evidence that these pollutants are associated with increased mortality and which one has the strongest association with mortality."
MethDef,"With effective degrees of freedom from 3 to 7, we can now fit some smoothing spline models."
MethJust,"Given that we identified slight heteroskedasticity and our smoothing spline model is not linear, we can not conduct a fully parametric or resampling of residuals bootstrap method."
MethJust,"Because I don't know the distribution of the residuals, I could not use parametric bootstrap."
Data,"Similarly, $ozone$ and $so2$ measures the median concentration of ozone/$SO_2$ (in parts per million) respectively, and $tmpd$ measures median temperature in Fahrenheit (1)"
Data,"Our dataset, as descibed above, has 347 observations of 14 variables."
Res,"However again, the shape of the plot isn’t very linear with a correlation of 0.176."
Int,This shows that the lag-model's inclusion of the pollutant variables benefits its fit with deaths in Chicago.
Data,"The positions of interest are again Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder, and Forward."
MethJust,The spline model with df of 5 has a MSE of 0.3565859 and Standard Error of 0.01059897.
Data,"The largest, or oldest, mean is for the never category, which has a mean of 34.187."
Struct,"Moving on, I create CI for mean number of deaths with the three pollutants and temperature."
Struct,"With this dataset and variables, we will try to answer the following three questions (2)"
Int,This represents the mean increase in viewsPerVideo from adding one subscriber.
Data,(6) All the plots we have shown thus far suggest an inverse relationship between longevity and mass-adjusted metabolism (or between their logs.
Lim,"Another limitation is that the data didn't include more variables that might affect both pollution and mortality, such as other weather variables."
MethDef,"Note that s() denotes a spline smoothing function and the subscript under the s denotes the degrees of freedom (i.e., 4 degrees of freedom)"
Int,"The effect a wildfire causes is thus not unified but varies greatly, and it is thus highly important for researchers to be able to pinpoint which wildfires specifically are likely to burn large areas."
Data,The collected data on player performances was published by the Guardian before the final (https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/jul/09/world-cup-2010-statistics).
Int,"In the previous section, we showed that there is a relationship between the channel and the number of words in a title."
MethJust,"In addition, since we are interested in studying the causal effect of 'Metabolic.by.mass' on 'Maximum.longevity.yrs', we must consider the omitted variable effect."
Lim,"In general, this is expected since we are aware that neither PM10 nor ozone pollution are normally distributed and both have longer right tails."
Context,The pursuit of (possibly indefinitely) long life has a legendary history - people have essentially always quested after immortality.
Context,"With the advent of platforms like OkCupid and Tinder, a person seeking a romantic partner no longer needs to frequently spend time at bars or ask friends to set up blind dates."
Int,"However, it is possible to make a more reliable casual claim, that lowering the metabolic rate of a crab-eating raccoon would lead to a 1.9-year increase in its maximum lifespan, under some assumptions."
Res,"We note that our bootstrap confidence interval is wider than the interval we generated from using R's built-in 'predict' function, [105.69, 112.44]"
Data,We will use $Max.lifespan$ as a measure of longevity in general.
Context,I hope this research shed some light into relationship between air pollution and mortality.
MethJust,"After doing so, we can see in the figure below(4) that the variable has a unimodal symmetric distribution."
Int,"Additionally, we can conclude that reducing the pollutants would cause mortality to decrease to the amount the model estimated, as our value for the prediction falls within a 95% confidence interval established by our model, indicating that we can reject the null hypothesis that decreasing the pollutants would have no effect at a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit."
Lim,"(3) As such, it is important to consider that the intervals calculated are based on a linear model that assumes these hold, when they are in fact violated, which may lead to inaccuracies in the predicted values."
Int,(1) Preston Jorgensen can not conclude that reducing pollutants would cause mortality to decrease to approximately 109 non-accidental deaths per day because our data is not causal and does not hypothesize a causal relationship between mortality and the reduction of air pollutants.
MethJust,So we need to plot the response on a log scale to see how it fits with the covariates.
Int,"Although our research does not align with the evidence of a relationship between sex and substance-use habits, we could infer that our volunteered sample produced bias within the data."
Context,"Acid rain, smog, and fires that seem to burn forever continue to ravage the Earth and its environment."
MethJust,We reached this conclusion after evaluating residuals and performing cross-validation and estimating standard error.
RQDef,"To answer Preston Jorgensen's question, whether animals with lower metabolic rates have longer lifespans, we take a look into Figure 9."
Res,Notice that 19 is within the confidence interval.
RQDef,"It seems reasonable to think that the older one gets, the more money they tend to make."
Lim,"For lag-ozone pollution, the association shows a similar issue with large error bounds at the tails, and particularly the right tail."
Lim,It looks like there is an unexplained negative trend in the residuals.
Res,"From this, we can infer that the mean (110.872) is slightly higher than the median for this data (108.300)."
Struct,"In justifying linearity, we can thus turn to the formal significance test for regression slope."
RQDef,We hypothesize that the number of subscribers across the given categories will be fairly consistent with the medians falling within the range of 1.5 to 2 million subscribers.
Res,The p-value for lagged sulfur dioxide is 0.0242 which suggests that we should fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 1% level.
Data,"According to the information provided with the data set, “the area burned by the fire is in hectares."
Other,"The model assumptions for Poisson GAMs are similar to those of linear models such that they include the errors are normal, homoskedastic, and that the observations are independent."
RQDef,Our first hypothesis will involve the relationship between the posts on a thread and the view count.
RQDef,"Ultimately, we are interested in whether men make more than women in yearly income."
Res,"Also, there are quite a few significant outliers in the data set that cause the mean to be high even though hundreds of plaintiffs received $0."
Data,"The AnAge Database is a database aggregated from scientific papers that maintains extensive longevity records regarding ""ageing and life history in animals""."
MethJust,"While the heat wave can be explained by temperature, there is other data suggesting these are an anomaly (other death rates on days with the same temperature were much lower)"
Data,"There was a mean of 3,201,757.576 subscribers and a standard deviation of 3,556,605.298."
Struct,The following figure displays a contingency table for proportion for each group.
Int,"Furthermore, there does seem to be a reasonably linear relationship between subscriber count and age."
Data,"Data collected for each animal included the Kingdom of the animal (taxonomic classification for a species), common name of the animal, maximum longevity in years ('Maximum.longevity.yrs'), body mass in grams ('Body.mass.g'), metabolic rate in Watts ('Metabolic.rate'), and typical body temperature in Kelvin ('Temperature')."
Int,"From the results of this research question, it does not appear as though the variable RH is a strong indicator of the variable area."
RQJust,"We chose News & Politics as the least frequent due to the assumption that people tend to watch news on TV channels, (especially local news) rather on YouTube."
Res,"On the other hand, our model estimated that the expectation for a crab-eating raccoon with a 50% slower metabolic rate would be 20.11787 years."
Data,"The dataset is composed of following variables name: 'HAGRID', 'Kingdom', 'Phylum', 'Class', 'Order', 'Family', 'Genus', 'Species', 'Common.name', 'Maximum.longevity.yrs', 'Body.mass.g', 'Metabolic.rate', and 'Temperature' (2)."
Struct,"However, it is important to note a few issues within the data."
Int,It seems like the number of subscribers could increase the likelihood of viewsPerVideo amounting to a greater value.
MethJust,The linear fit has modest success in accounting for variation.
Res,As 'Maximum.longevity.yrs' decreases by 0.3999% when 'Metabolic.by.mass' increases by 1 %.
Context,This can help Mr. Jorgensen have an idea of the mean mortality on a typical 70-degree day given the 7-day average of pollutants are minimized to the lowest levels recorded in the dataset.
Data,"Taking a look at the normality plots (figures not shown), both Lifespan and Metabolic.by.mass variables seem to have a lack of normality."
Struct,(1) We would like to explore each of the key variables to understand their distributions and potential outliers.
Res,The data tells us that the median is around 1.218 million views per video.
Context,This work may be of help by assisting how we rank and promote discussion forums.
MethDef,We first test on $H_0:$ the null model (which only contains the intercept term) is correct versus $H_1:$ Model 2 is correct.
MethDef,And I conduct the following hypothesis test: begin{center} Null Hypothesis: $H_0$: Model 3 is correct end{center} begin{center} Alternative Hypothesis: $H_a$: My model (Model 2) is correct end{center}
Int,"Therefore, with our modelling and analysis and results, we believe Presten Jorgensen can conclude that reducing pollutants would cause mortality to decrease."
Res,"In the histogram (Figure 2), we can see that there are many Entertainment videos in the data set and they do fairly well."
Data,"Based on the histogram, we can see that our response is approximately symmetrical and normally distributed."
Data,"Boxplots (figure not shown) were also made for pm10median, o3median, so2median, and tmpd which all displayed a normal distribution with only a few outliers."
Data,"The overall mean value across all channels was 3,201,758 subscribers with a standard deviation of 3,556,605."
Res,The ANOVA yields a test statistic of F = 33.3328 and a p-value of approximately 0.
Res,"Similar to when we previously discussed the distribution and shape of viewsPerVideo, we take note of how this distribution is skewed to the right."
Data,"To answer our research questions, we will be utilizing the 'chicago.csv' dataset, which contains daily measurements of air quality, total number of non-accidental deaths, and mean temperature in Chicago, IL from January 1987 to December 2000"
MethDef,"(3) In order to determine which of these models fits the data best, we do a standard 5-fold cross-validation test on each spline model and the linear model."
Res,We see from figure 5 that the slope of the curves is the steepest for the plot of $lag_ozone$
MethDef,We will use one-way ANOVA here since we have more than two groups.
Data,'o3median' is the median concentration of ozone (parts per billion)
Lim,Our analysis is limited a certain period therefore the results may vary now in 2021 so the results cannot be generalized to all years.
Int,This difference is a good thing because it leads us to believe that our model meets its assumptions better than we originally though.
Res,We can also see that people with 0 to 5 million subscribers tend to gain views per video ranging from 0 to 5 million views.
MethJust,"Therefore, we decided to use bootstrapping by resampling cases, since we want the distribution of the generated data based on the distribution from which the actual 'death' data were drawn."
Res,"(2) Furthermore, we were able to help Preston Jorgensen conclude that reducing a crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% would cause its lifespan to increase by nearly 9%, with the lower bound for our 95% interval we were predicting the average lifespan to be greater than the original average lifespan."
Res,We can also see that there is indeed variation between the means of the views for the various categories.
MethJust,"This is because not only did the spline models have very close prediction error estimates, they also had very close estimated standard errors (5)."
Struct,We should however also check if we violate any assumptions of the Simple Linear Regression model.
Context,"If we want to understand how sexism interacts with other societal tools (like income, education, and drinking), dating services are a great way to do so."
RQDef,"Being hired by Jorgesen, we are interested in the following three questions regarding this objective: (i) whether there is supported evidence that slowing the metabolic rate may increase lifespan."
MethDef,Since many of our plots have indicate nonlinear relationships we can consider a log transform for these variables.
MethDef,"To promote the usefulness of the prediction, we will use the day 30 December 2000 (which is the latest to present) in our prediction."
Res,"Bootstrapping by resampling residuals allowed us to find a 95% confidence interval for the estimated lifespan of the crab-eating raccoon, assuming a 50% slower metabolic rate by mass, which was 17.45691 years to 21.54319 years (3)."
Data,The plot does not appear normal.
Context,"When the defendants are judged to be guilty in court, they are expected to pay punitive damages to the plaintiff as a remedy for their misconduct."
Int,Thus this would amount to almost a 9% increase in added average lifespan for this raccoon.
RQDef,The third question explores the relationship between age and duration of stay.
Int,"(1) As requested by Preston Jorgensen, we do find evidence with our selected model that animals with lower metabolic rates do have longer lifespans."
Res,"Our chi-square test returns an x squared value of 110.19, a df of 36, and a p-value of 1.884e-09."
MethDef,"HA: Drug use and status are dependent, and show an association."
MethJust,"Based on the results of the 5-fold cross-validation, the GAM with lagged covariates has a lower prediction error than the GAM with non-lagged covariates, with a difference of 11.58"
Data,"The distribution of $Metabolic.by.mass$ also seems to be heavily right-skewed, with a mean of $4.405times 10^{-3}$ Watts per gram and median of $3.023times 10^{-3}$ per gram (2)."
MethDef,The r^2 value of the correlation may help us further understand their relationship.
Data,The distribution of the total number of video uploads is also intensely right skewed with a large number of very high outliers.
Other,"As the averages of the temperature and pollution variables have the same distributions as the medians, we will not be plotting the relationship of the averages with death rate as the underlying distribution of the relationship between death rate and the averages and death rate and the medians should be the same."
Lim,"To fix heteroscedasticity, Third, there might be other confounder variables that is not included in the dataset, for example environment temperature, that may affect the conclusion."
MethJust,"Thus, we could conclude our model is correct, and the main assumptions (linearity (correctness), i.id, homoscedasticity, Gaussian error) of our model holds (7)"
Data,(3) Figure 11 shows a slightly negative correlation between logarithmic death rate and temperature.
RQDef,"Since we are also interested in determining whether or not our predictors are most influential to deaths over short spans of time instead on any given particular day, we will look at our lag-variables separately from our original variables."
Res,The scatterplot depicting views vs posts demonstrates a positive and linear correlation.
Data,"These additional variables are income, education, and drinking."
Data,"In the scatterplot of log of deaths against date, we can see that there are several outliers with many more deaths than usual."
MethJust,All three pollutant plots are more difficult to interpret due to sparse data possibly causing curvature on the ends.
Int,"Finally, there could be another lurking variable that counteracts the effects RH has on the total area burned."
RQDef,"To understand this objective, we seek to answer three main questions of interest to Preston Jorgensen, (1) Are these three air pollutants associated with increased mortality."
Data,"'pm10median' is the median density of PM10 pollution, i.e. particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers (milligrams per cubic meter)"
Context,"As the global population increases, the need to identify and categorize areas where deadly wildfires are likely to occur is critical to ensuring their damage to life and property is mitigated."
Data,"The lowest value, other than those who do not wish to report, is 20,000, while the highest is 1,000,000."
MethJust,The resulting plot was very heavily skewed left with what appeared to be several outliers.
RQDef,"(2) Then, we would analyze whether the effect of pollution is instantaneous or extends over time."
Data,"As shown in table 1, the mean area is 12.895 ha and the median area is 0.52 ha."
MethDef,"(2) Using non-parametric bootstrapping with resampling cases with 1000 bootstrap iterations, the 95% pivotal confidence interval for lifespan of an animal with those characteristics is [31.56516, 41.40858] in years."
Data,"I call this varible ""metabolic by mass""."
Struct,Figure 1 below shows the univariate distribution of explantory variables without lag.
Int,Should we use these variables in a model we may have to account for multicollinearity.
RQDef,"But how does this correlate with body type, a factor that can be another measure for health."
Int,"The effect of pollution appears to be extended over time, based on our cross-validation results from the previous section."
RQJust,"We can see that people who are single, seeing someone, available , or married mostly have a height around 70 inches."
Data,Roughly 90% of the animals in our data set will have a maximum longevity of less than 30 years and a metabolic rate (using the formula we previously described) of less than 0.01.
RQJust,This increase may suggest that the effect of pollution actually extends over time.
Int,"Again, we have not confirmed there to be a relationship between sex and another response variable (smoking habits)."
Data,We can also notice the right skewedness of PlayTime as there are less and less plots as the x-axis increases.
Lim,We could expect these variables to vary based on the different coaching styles of each team.
Data,There is some variation between the medians but it is not very significantly different.
RQDef,(5) We calculated the smallest value observed for each pollution variable and used these to create an estimate using our chosen model for the mean number of deaths on a 70-degree day with those levels of pollutants.
Int,"We are therefore able to infer that lower measurements of pollution are associated with lower mortality in Chicago, but recommend further investigation into this relationship independent of the given seasons."
Res,"Using the model, we were able to calculate that if the pollutants were at their historical lows on a 70 degree day, there would be about 4 deaths (was exactly 4.68 deaths) on average."
Context,This can impact the aim of a creator and help them determine if they need more followers or a better understanding of the YouTube algorithm.
Int,"This number is lower than the actual mortality in Chicago on 30 December 2000, which is 145 people."
MethDef,"To further identify the relationship between ISI and area, we can model simple linear regression between the the two variables."
Data,"Metabolic Rate by Mass in W/g ('Metabolic.by.mass') has mean of 4.405e-03 W/g, median of 3.023e-03 W/g and range of 4.543e-05 W/g to 4.143e-02 W/g."
RQDef,"In order to answer the second research question regarding the Crab-eating raccoon, we start by obtaining its features."
Data,The mean value demanded is about 1029742.66 dollars and the standard deviation for Demanded is 60286.50.
Struct,There are lots of limitations with our analysis and with the data in general (3)
Res,"The outliers lie very high the number of views, ranging from around 11 million to 211 million."
Lim,"On top of that, both ANOVA and chi-squared tests require random sampling, but our dataset was based upon volunteer sampling."
Data,"In figures 1 and 6, we can see that the distribution of daily temperature and temperature averaged over 7 days are both bimodal with modes at roughly 30 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit, and both are also skewed slightly left."
Lim,"To save time, we construct a relatively simple model (using 4 degrees of freedom for all spline terms)"
Res,"In the previous section, we see that Model 2, which uses lagged variables, has a smaller estimated MSE than Model 1 that assumes the effects are instantaneous."
Data,(1) This new measure of energy per unit of body mass will be reported in Watts per grams.
MethDef,"We will let the null model be model two, and null hypothesis be that model two is the correct model."
MethJust,The estimated MSE and SE values are simply too close and it seems possible that changing the seed could potentially result in even smaller differences in values between the linear and spline model.
MethDef,"Also, since log death shows a non-linear trend with the covariates, we would fit an additive model with spline smoother terms."
Data,"It appears that log-death is most associated with temperature, wherein there is a mild, negative association that suggests deaths increase with lower temperatures."
Other,"However, this may not always be the case."
Struct,"In the table below, we display the pivotal confidence interval that we have generated as a result of our bootstrapping, as well as the original confidence interval."
RQJust,This is because higher water content in plants is known as a factor that decreases the likelihood of fires starting due to its high specific heat constant.
Data,"Temperature seems to have a positive relationship with ozone, but shows no clear relationships with sulfur dioxide or PM10 pollution."
Int,Further note that this matches with the summary of models where p-value of Ozone was the smallest.
Int,"Depending on what people are interested in today’s society, those channels may change."
Res,"We ran 1000 bootstrap iterations and found a confidence interval of approximately [18.76, 23.07] (Table 2) (3)."
Lim,Future studies should try to fix the errors we had in our study.
Data,"For both distributions, the left tail is longer than the right, but the most frequent range of temperature is for warmer days, while colder days span a larger range."
MethDef,"After formulating these confidence intervals, we can then compare these two confidence intervals and determine differences between the two methods."
MethDef,We want to bootstrap to make a 95% confidence interval for the mean number of deaths.
RQJust,"In the distribution, we observe that the age 30 seems to split the sample distribution in half (which is why we choose it as our hypothesis value), with a large concentration of users between 18 and 30, while a significant portion of the users make up the tale between 30 and 65."
Int,"This is surprising, given that we predicted that more videos uploaded would mean more subscribers to the channel."
MethDef,"In the end, we built two Poisson generalized additive models: one with not lagged covariates and one with lagged covariates."
Int,The data proves that countries with greater populations and countries with greater global influence garner more views per video.
Struct,"With this information, these hypotheses will be examined."
Int,That also means that higher subcriber counts do not cause high views.
MethDef,"Because we pass all ANOVA requirements, we can begin carrying out a test at level 0.05."
Res,The Music histogram is rightly skewed but not as heavily as Entertainment.
RQDef,"Given the established model, what does it predict for the mean lifespan for an animal with crab-eating raccoon's characteristics but a 50% smaller metabolic rate."
Res,"We then compute that counts of the three months add up to 233, which accounts for about 45.1% of all counts."
Struct,We will be working with two key variables.
Data,The data we have contains 6 variables with 5114 unique observations.
Data,We will be using a specific set of data containing information from 347 different species in the Chordata phylum (meaning we collected data from only vertebrates).
Int,There is no sufficient evidence to conclude that there is an association between status and age.
RQJust,From the table above we are able to see that there is a decent amount of variation of the playtime across the different positions.
Int,"Therefore, we do not recommend that Jorgensen should spend his enormous fortune to try to reduce pollution to their lowest levels recorded in the data because we can not assert that pollution has a causal effect on mortality."
Lim,"The relationship concluded as a result of this data, however, was limiting in the sense that other factors that would largely affect viewsPerVideo were not accounted for."
Int,"We first saw that the best position for playtime is by far Goalkeeper, the best position for shots attempted is Forward followed closely by Midfielder, and the best position for total passes is Defender followed closely by Midfielder."
Int,"The p-value of the test is very close to 0, meaning that the chosen model with the covariates included is not sufficient to explain the data and we would prefer a saturated model."
Context,Studying this may be useful for those who are thinking of joining YouTube and would like to gather information about the most popular creators.
MethJust,"As Model 1 and 2 have the same complexity ($df = 21$), we choose Model 2 as it performs slightly better."
Res,The trend seems to be linear around 0 to 5M and the density of data points around that location is high.
Int,The left skew of temperature might be explained as Chicago's weather changes frequently depending on the time of the year.
MethDef,"We will randomly sample the folds from the original data into a test and train set, and use the same folds for each model."
Res,"It peaks around 1 million as well, but the right tail is much longer."
MethDef,"We are using cross-validation here, specifically k-fold cross-validation with $k = 5$."
Other,Here the residuals are the deviance residuals.
Data,There are 139 missing datapoints.
MethDef,"To determine the significance of the association between pollutants and mortality alone, we will create a lagged GAM that only uses temperature as a feature, not the pollutants."
MethJust,"In addition, many areas of the city lost power entirely while the city officials did not announce warnings of the heat wave until the 3rd day."
Struct,Figure 5 displays a boxplot showing the relationship between the number of shares when compared to each channel.
Data,“Average” makes up 27% of all users with 0.4% of all users preferring not to answer.
Data,"In figure 3, we also see that the relationships between $death$ and $lag_tmpd$ and $time$ to be strong (5)"
MethDef,"While we will also use 'time' (number of days before/after Dec 31, 1993) in our analysis, it will serve as an index and doesn't require further analysis."
MethDef,The model is as follows (1): $Lifespan = beta_0 + beta_1MRate$.
Struct,The following is a histogram of relative humidity measured when wildfires occurred.
MethDef,"Using observed values, we can calculate the expected cell count values (if the null hypothesis is true), by using the product of the observed marginals divided by the grand total."
Int,Perhaps this can be attributed to people lying about their income on the app.
MethDef,"(4) For the model we chose, we plotted the average relationship between each predictor and the outcome with uncertainty bars and can determine from the plots that ozone concentration is the pollutant most associated with mortality because its relationship with deaths looks the least flat and uniform."
MethDef,"Using the model's deviance and residuals, we calculated the chisquare distribution function and determined the p-value was approximately 0"
MethDef,"To measure this, we will need to conduct an inferential test and we will choose an alpha value of 1%."
RQDef,Our next research question will be to analyze the relationship between the subscriber counts of each country in the data.
Res,"After performing the significance test, the p-value is about very close to 0, which is less than any alpha significance level and can therefore reject the Null hypothesis."
Int,"We could also make a stronger casual claim using Model 1.2, under the assumption that $Class$, $Body.mass.g$, and $Temperature$ are the only three confounding variables in the relationship between $Age.log$ and $Metabolic.log$."
Data,The average life span for a normal crab-eating raccoon is 19 years according to our dataset.
RQDef,"Lastly, using the model we construct, we will determine what the expected mean lifespan of an animal with the crab-eating raccoon’s characteristics, but with a 50% smaller metabolic rate (1)."
RQDef,"(1) We are interested in studying the relationships between levels of pollution and how it affects mortality in Chicago, IL, and whether or not this relationship is instantaneous or time lagged."
MethJust,"There are some difference, but still not very significant when we look at the MSE of the linear model (the difference is larger mainly because we are using an additional variable here)."
Data,We notice “jacked” is an outlier with only 7 non drug users.
Context,"However, no amount of money as of yet has been able to overcome mortality."
Struct,A 95% confidence interval for the prediction is also shown on the graph.
Struct,The graph uses the fitted values for the selected (best) model against logged Metabolic Rate by Mass.
Res,"Thus, if air pollution is at such a minimum level, and the median temperature is 70 degrees in Chicago, our model predicts that the expected mortality on December 30 2000 is 107.2518 people."
Data,It is important to note that there are very different group sizes.
Struct,Our null and alternative hypotheses are as follows.
RQDef,"Specifically, the goal of this report is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to investigate if the position of a soccer player affects their statistics in terms of playtime, shots attempted, and total passes made."
RQDef,Our first hypothesis will will involve the mean age of the profiles.
Data,"Subscribers is a quantitative variable that tells how many subscribers, or followers, a channel has."
Data,"Overall, the summary data seems to agree with figure 1 in which our variables seem normally distributed with some skewedness and outliers."
Context,This video-sharing platform is the second most popular social network and has over 2 billion users world-wide.
Int,"While India has a significantly greater population than the United States and Great-Britain (according to a 2021 Worldometer consensus: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/india-population/), the United States and Great-Britain have a greater global influence (United States more than Great-Britian) (as reported by US News in a 2020 consensus: https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/influence-rankings)."
MethDef,We first conducted a global goodness-of-fit test on the selected model.
MethDef,"For the remainder of our analysis, we will use model 2 since our cross validation techniques determined that it was the better model of the two (3)"
Int,"However, Preston Jorgensen can not conclude that reducing pollutants would cause morality to decrease to this estimation, because this is observational data."
Data,Sex is a categorical variable that characterizes users’ sex into male or female.
MethDef,"To find this, we find the individual area variables of each fire, then sum them up and categorize them by month to find the Total Area per Month of Year, as follows."
Data,"Conversely, people who drink “not at all” have a proportion of “never” drug users of 0.057 and a proportion of “often” drug users of only 0.001."
Struct,"In Figure 4, we look at the deaths over time (3)"
Data,"The mean playtime was 208.864 minutes, with a standard deviation of about 145.434."
Data,The date is also recorded.
Int,"Therefore, through the previous two data examples that have been shown, there is in fact no relationship between how fast your channel grows and which category someone decides to get into."
Lim,"But with more data from multiple World Cups, the analysis and conclusions can be more reasonably generalized to the World Cup in general."
MethDef,"This can be found by summarizing the relationship between the mean viewsPerVideo, the standard deviation, and the category."
MethDef,"To answer the questions Preston Jorgenson asked of us, we constructed two Poisson generalized additive models (GAM) where one uses the original covariates while the other uses lagged covariates (1)"
Res,"With the selected linear model, (1) since the coefficient for metabolic by mass is negative (-0.28697), we can conclude that animals with lower metabolic rates have longer lifespans, as requested by Preston Jorgensen."
Res,Entertainment videos aren’t very likely to get more than 5 million views because of the heavy right skew peaking at around 1 million.
MethJust,We chose to use 4 degrees of freedom for simplicity and speed.
MethDef,"In summary, there appears to be an underlying Poisson relationship in which increased death rate and corresponds to increased 7-day average of median ozone concentration, median sulfur dioxide concentration, median density of $PM_{10}$ pollution, and temperature, which we can model using a Poisson generalized additive model."
RQDef,"Specifically, the research questions proposed are: Is there evidence that pollutants are associated with increased mortality, and which ones have the strongest association."
Data,"The most popular country is the United States (595 out of the 1259 users sampled were from the United States making up 47% of the sample) and the least popular country is Italy (8 out of 1259 users in the sample were from Italy, comprising 0.6% of the 1259 users)."
Struct,Figure 3 is a scatterplot depicting the number of non-accidental deaths over the time period this dataset records.
Data,"The month with the highest median for DMC was August, with a median DMC of 145.4, and a max DMC of 273.8."
MethDef,"Since our assumptions are met, we can perform the test at level 0.01."
Res,The 95% confidence interval for this prediction is from 106.39 deaths to 114.633 deaths.
MethDef,"(1) Next, we wish to assess if a linear model is truly the correct fit, and as such we will employ smoothing splines to create a more flexible model."
MethDef,"While such an event seems like it should be disregarded in our data, we have chosen to keep it."
MethJust,"Henceforth, all references to Metabolic Rate will refer to this standardized quantity, which is measured in units of Watts/gram (1)."
Data,"Now, we will look into our response variable, 'death' (number of non-accidental deaths on a particular day)"
RQDef,"Next, we sought to determine the average lifespan of the crab-eating raccoon with a 50% smaller metabolic rate."
MethJust,"We also looked at normality plots for metabolic rate and lifespan (figure not shown), which both showed clear devation from normality."
RQJust,"We see that Other, Social Media, and Lifestyle get a lot of shares when compared to other channels, suggesting that there is most likely a relationship between channel and number of shares."
MethDef,"To do so, we will be comparing our lagged GAM with a saturated model."
MethDef,We will use one-way ANOVA here since we have more than two groups.
Context,"However, even after this life-saving procedure is done, patients are still at risk."
Struct,"Before examining our null and alternative hypotheses, we want to view our two variables visually, with a comparative bar plot (Figure 5, below)."
Context,"Despite these limitations, our model provides a well-established framework for analyzing the relationship between air pollution and mortality."
Struct,"Since we model the log of our response, figure 2 below shows both the original distribution of our response, death, and the distribution on the log scale."
Int,"Furthermore, three countries, the United States, India, and Great-Britain have a significant number of outliers, possibly due to variables such as industrialization (the United States and Great Britain) and population density (India) which could be influencing the popularity of these accounts as well as subscriber access to mobile devices, which can be used to view social media content."
Res,"If we take a look at Table 1, the correlation coefficient is 0.135."
Int,The model fits well to the data.
Data,"For the variables death, pm10median, o3median, and so2median, we can see very high max values relative to the mean and median which suggests that there are outliers for very high values."
Data,"We can draw observations from fig 3 like that non drug users have the highest proportion of “social” drinkers with a proportion of 0.439, whereas “often” drug users have a proportion of “social” drinkers of only 0.005."
Int,We conclude that the number of shares each article gets is heavily dependent on the channel that article falls into and the number of words in the title.
MethJust,"It is noteworthy that the violations to the model assumptions are caused by very few outliers, which means the violations to model assumptions are minor."
Int,"(2) Meanwhile, our model shows the effect of pollution affects the death rate over the next few days."
MethJust,"Graphs relating variables like Temperature to Longevity showed a clearly lacking relationship, and so that variable will be disregarded moving forward."
Data,"The positions of interest are once again Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder, and Forward."
Data,"(2) To analyze these questions, I use data from the AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity."
Context,"The ability to live forever means no longer having to fear death, you can see loved ones forever and see how the world changes from decade to decade and millenium to millenium."
Res,"Visually, there is not a clear relation between account age and views per video."
Struct,Next we will explore the relationships between animals' lifespans and their metabolic rates to better understand how to fit the models.
Data,"However, after the transformation, we see in figure 3 that $Temperature$ does not seems to be related to $Max.lifespan$."
Data,"The mean account age is 305 weeks, with a standard deviation of 173.1 weeks."
MethJust,"Between the improvement to histograms in Figure 3 and the improvement in the pairs plot in Figure 4, we are confident that log trasforming the response, Maximum.longevity.yrs, and the main quantitative predictor, Metabolic.by.mass was an helpful decision and one we will stick with for the rest of the report."
Struct,Figure 12 depicts the residual plots and qq plot for our selected model.
Struct,"Next, we will assess any relationships between predictor variables and the response variable, longevity."
Data,"The mean subscriber count for the youtube accounts in our analysis is approximately 1.95 million, with the smallest and largest subscriber counts for an account being approximately 107.33 thousand and 27.77 million respectively."
MethDef,We decided that the best model was the spline model with 5 effective degrees of freedom because it had the lowest MSE (3).
Res,A correlation of 0.135 does show a positive relationship but a very weak one.
Context,"However, substances can undoubtedly have a huge impact on people’s lives."
Data,A key difference in this correlation plot (Figure 5) compared to Figure 4 with non-lagged variables is that the correlations between all lagged covariates and the response are significant and stronger.
MethJust,We see that the effect size of $Metabolic.log$ is smaller after controlling for other covariates.
MethJust,"Though for some df, the MSE of smoothing spline differs more from the MSE of linear model, the uncertainty is also greater, making the difference less significant."
RQDef,"The first being whether air pollutants are associated with increased mortality, and if so, which of these pollutants seems most strongly associated with mortality."
Int,"There may be many other variables at large that affect mortality and pollutant levels, so we do not know that reducing pollutants would decrease mortality even though there is an associative relationship since this is observational data."
MethDef,"We decided to log transform the response variable, maximum.longevity.yrs, and the quantitative predictor variables, metabolic.by.mass and temperature, as they are all skewed (with maximum.longevity.yrs and metabolic.by.mass both being right skewed), before we model our data."
MethDef,"Based on a little research on Chicago's seasons, we classify summer as May-October and winter as November-April."
MethDef,"Since the conditions are mostly satisfied, we choose to proceed with the ANOVA test at the 0.05 significance level."
Context,This begs the question of what the Netherlands team has been doing wrong to keep losing the title of the World Champions.
MethJust,It is common knowledge that the ideal temperature for comfortable living is 72 F
MethDef,"Initially, we applied the four explanatory variables on a Poisson generalized linear model(GLM) and a Poisson generalized additive model(GAM) with four degrees of freedom and compared the two models using a chi-squared test."
Lim,"Since there are approximately 31 million youtube channels, we believe a larger sample size may more accurately represent the relationship between subscriber count and the variables presented in this analysis."
Lim,"However, we must address the biases that exist in this study."
Data,"Consequently, the scatter plots in figure 2 also suggest that the relationship between $death.log$ and explanatory variables are highly affected by outliers (which is likely to be these observations in 1995)"
MethJust,"We see from the residual plot that the residuals contain outliers, which means that the residuals are not identically distributed."
Data,"Our main focus will be on the variable Category, a categorical variable indicating what content is posted on the channel."
MethJust,The model appears to fit well for few reasons.
Lim,"In other words, given a larger sample size, we expect that Model 2 would fit significantly better than Model 1"
MethDef,"To determine whether the model we choose fits well, we conducted a global goodness-of-fit test."
Data,"The main focus of this report is on the analysis of viewsPerVideo, a quantitative variable that is the users total number of views divided by their total number of videos posted."
Data,"The maximum for midfielders is 15, the maximum for forwards is 27, the maximum for defenders is 11, and the maximum for goalkeepers is 1."
MethJust,"As we increase the degrees of freedom in our spline model from 3 to 7, we notice that the MSE's decrease until it hits a trough at 6, and then increases after that."
RQJust,"While all of the days have different minimums and maximums, their median and quartiles are all about the same, suggesting that there may be no relationship between the two variables."
Data,Severity is a quantitative variable and a measure of how severe each patient’s liver disease was.
Struct,Figure 4 displays a boxplot showing the relationship between title length depending on the day of publication.
MethDef,The new model is as follows: Death ~ $beta_0$ + s('lag_temperature')
Data,"The data was gathered by Opta, a company which gathers data on sports all over the world, and this data consists of multiple variables pertaining to the 595 players that participated in the 2010 World Cup."
Res,"Similarly, an increase in particulate matter seems to be associated with an increase in mortality."
RQDef,"In this project, we examine the possible relationships between sex and drinking, smoking, and drugs habits."
MethJust,"Second, according to the exploratory data analysis, a nonparametric model may better capture the overall curvature in the data."
MethJust,"After examining the residual diagnostics for our best Spline model in Figure 8, it appears that our linearity, normality, and constant variance assumptions hold."
MethDef,"To make the modeling easier, we have decided to use a log transformation on the death variable."
Int,Thus this evidence supports our hypothesis and further proves the negative correlation.
RQJust,This revelation is useful as we explore the association between mortality and air quality because it shows that a change in levels for a pollutant can potentially have a stronger impact on death if it's consistent over multiple days.
MethDef,This indicates that the number of parameters in the saturated model is equal to the size of the dataset.
Data,Another thing we observe is that the interquartile ranges for the Midfielder and Forward positions are both between 50 and 300 while the interquartile range for the Defender position is between 100 and 400.
Context,People often wonder how the algorithm works.
Res,We can also see that the data is skewed right because there is a tail of gradually decreasing data points as the DMC gets higher.
Int,This suggests that animals with slower metabolic rates generally have longer lifespans.
Int,"Model 5 does not control for any potential confounding variables, which means that casual claims drawn based on Model 5 are likely to be invalid."
MethDef,"Let p(mC) denote the population probability of men who have graduated college or university, and let p(fC) denote the population probability of women who have graduated college or university."
Data,"The mean subscriber count in the sample is about 3,201,758 with a standard deviation of 3,556,605 subscribers."
MethDef,"We want to use a new variable, Metabolic.by.mass, instead of Metabolic.rate."
Other,"Model assumptions for smooth splines are similar to those of linear models such that they include the errors are normal, homoskedastic, and that the observations are independent."
MethJust,"However, given the degree of flexiblity that already exists in our model, there are no significant improvements that we could make at this point (4)."
Int,"However, there was a noticeable positive correlation between viewsPerVideo and the category in which a Youtuber’s content falls under."
Data,"We also try to transform the two variables, and from the scatterplots, we can see that there seems to be some semi linear relationship between log body mass and our response variable, while temperature seems to be unrelated."
Int,"After statistical analysis conducted on the data set we have using two key variables, the maximum longevity and metabolic rate, we may conclude that lifespan increases as metabolic rate decreases (meaning they have negative relationship), the two variables have non-linear relationship, and decreasing the metabolic rate of the crab-eating raccoon by 50% would increase its lifespan by 2.34173 years (3)."
Res,"Performing a Chi-squared test on body_type and drinks gives us an x-squared value of 172.15, a df of 72, and a p-value of 3.512e-10."
Int,"This would mean that for every unit of DMC, the moisture content excluding humidity would increase by 2.64."
Data,"The first of these is the response variable, 'Maximum.longevity.yrs', the maximum lifespan in years of the species."
MethDef,"From this relationship, we can assume that a greater play time results in a greater number of shots attempted, so we will use a one-sided regression test for the slope with an alternative slope being greater than, with the following hypotheses."
MethJust,Because of these somewhat skeptical assumptions we choose to bootstrap our previous confidence interval using the resampling residuals method because it doesn't rely on assumptions of the distribution of the residuals.
Int,There is no direct relationship between the category that someone decides to get into and the growth of their channel.
Data,The key variables we will be exploring will be lifespan and metabolic rates across the 347 species in the subset of the AnAge Database.
Res,"From our test, we get a p-value of 0 using a Chi square test."
Int,Slower metabolic rate is associated with longer lifespan.
MethDef,"Before we look into the data, we first create a new variable called 'Metabolic.by.mass' in which divides metabolic rate ('Metabolic.rate') by body mass ('Body.mass.g') for each observations."
RQJust,The relationship between PlayTime and TotalPasses is relatively linear and the spread of the data is reasonably consistent (as shown with the linear regression model).
Struct,"In Figure 1, we see the histograms for both lifespan and metabolic rate."
Res,"From the anova test, it appears that there is indeed an association."
Data,"Using $time$, we recover the $date$ variable, which measures the date of the observation."
RQDef,"In this analysis, we will examine exactly how the age of one’s Youtube account is related to various measures of success on Youtube such as subscriber count and view per video."
MethJust,"This means that we need to incorporate the non-linearity (e.g., use smoothing splines or include polynomial terms) in our model (5)"
MethDef,We constructed a linear model and 5 smooth spline models to fit the relationship between lifespan and metabolic rate and answer Jorgensen's questions.
Struct,The figure below visualizes income levels among the entire sample population.
Data,"Plotting the deaths over time shown in Figure 4, we noticed there were some obvious outliers for the number of deaths for July 1995 - the highest number of daily deaths recorded in the dataset were 411, which happened on July 14, 1995"
MethDef,"Thus, a log-transformation was applied to the suspect features."
MethDef,"Therefore, , we also fit a multiple regression model, which uses all the key variables ($Metabolic.log$, $Body.mass.g$, $Class$, and $Temperature$, all after log transformation) to predict $Age.log$."
MethJust,"Calculating the expected cell counts, we find that not every single cell has at least 5."
MethJust,In regard to all of the categorical variables in the dataset we decided that since these variables are primarily identifying variables and would consquently not be useful for our analysis.
Int,"This disparity in number of videos uploaded may highly influence how the number of views per video metric will change for each channel, since having a few really popular videos (and only those videos) will greatly increase views per video compared to a channel with many popular videos (but also many videos in general)."
MethJust,This means that we can not confidently say that our best performing smooth spline model is a better fit to the data than a linear model.
MethDef,We didn't include date as a predictor because we are not interested in its effect on mortality.
Res,The mean and median values of total damages of the fraud category are both higher than others.
MethJust,This will allow comparisons between animals of different sizes.
Struct,"When viewing how each month contributes to the total area burnt in a year, we can use the following pie chart."
MethDef,We then test on $H_0:$ Model 3 is correct versus $H_1:$ Model 2 is correct.
Res,"We see that the two CI's are similar, and they cover approximately the same region (7)"
Lim,"This analysis has its limitations, as the data only provided the attempted shots, not the successful ones."
Context,"As a result, many writers and companies are extremely careful and self-aware about factors that could affect the number of shares one gets, some of these being the title of the length and the different channels available."
Lim,This is a minor violation of the homoskedasticity assumption.
RQDef,"To address Mr.Jorgensen's concern, we want to explore the level of mortality in Chicago when air pollution is reduced to the lowest level in the historical record."
Struct,Figure 6 depicts the residual plot and qq plot for our selected model.
Int,"Based on our cross-validation results in the previous section, we believe that the effect of pollution appears to extend over time."
MethDef,This is how we evaluated potential outliers.
Data,"The mean area value is 12.895 hectares, while the high range (1090.740) and far right-skewed data and high standard deviation (63.646) suggest that there are significant variations in-between fires."
Data,"As before, men outnumber women, which may be a result of uneven population sizes."
Context,"Lastly, drugs are known to lead to health hazards."
Lim,January 2000 to December 2003 is only three years in total.
MethDef,"It is possible that other nonlinear transformations of our variables (Lifespan and Metabolic.by.mass) could result in residuals that do not have indications of assumption violations (specifically constant variance and Gaussian noise assumptions), but we chose log transformation because it seemed to be the best choice for fitting our models to our data (4)."
Context,"Different substances are all around us, and can have a very large impact on individuals’ lives."
MethJust,"From the residual plot, we could conclude that our model fits well and successfully captures the patterns in the data, as the residuals appear to be patternless (4)."
Res,Lagged PM10 median and pagged SO2 median displays similar convexity.
MethJust,"This confidence interval was created using the 'predict' function on R, which means there is an underlying assumption that our model is ""correct"""
Int,"Given this, we can say with 95% certainty that the true relationship between square root of the lifespan of a species and square root of the metabolic rate per unit body mass is negative and linear, indicating that animals with a lower metabolic rate have longer lifespans."
Lim,Some limitations to our report is the limited amount of data to analyze.
MethJust,"So we decided not to include 'time' in our model, as the observations can be well explained by other variables like 'tmpd.diff'"
Data,"(6) From Figure 3, we can see for the most part linear, negative relationship."
Data,"Now, that we have the plots without the outliers, we can see that there are still no very clear patterns and lots out clustering besides temperature which has a slightly negative trend (5)"
Data,There are 6 major variables in the $Chicago$ data set.
MethJust,It seems like there's no sign of violation of assumptions.
Struct,Table 1 depicts the prediction errors and standard errors for the linear and spline models we produced using 5-fold cross-validation (3).
Int,This allows us to conclude that we have sufficient evidence that there is a positive linear relationship between PlayingTime and TotalPasses made.
Data,O3 median is also right skewed but not as much as these two variables with mean 2.024481 parts by billion.
MethDef,We ran a one-sample z test for the mean (We do not know the sigma but the sample size is large enough that the t distribution would be almost the same as a normal distribution) and found that the test statistic is z = -5.0703 and the p-value is approximately 0.
Res,"When examining the median across channel categories, there is a range between 600K and 2M, only with the exception of “News & Politics” with median 18.6K."
Lim,"If we were provided with the successful shots, it would make the findings more accurate because we could see if these factors actually contributed to the team winning."
Int,Maybe this category seems the most general and is the most alluring to creators that do not know what to label their channel as.
Res,"We clearly see a strong negative association between death and temperature, similar to what we noted in the EDA"
RQJust,It seems to suggest that there might be some association between seaons and death rate.
Int,"Second, we used another ANOVA test to conclude that there is sufficient evidence for a relationship between income and drug usage."
Data,Our analysis focused primarily on category popularity as well as user base.
Struct,"In tables 1 and 2, we can see summary statistics for all the daily (table 1) and lagged (table 2) variables in our dataset."
Struct,The table below summarizes the result.
RQDef,"Based on the evidence as provided below, we hypothesize that entertainment is the most popular category of YouTube video."
Int,"(4) Because of this, we may have some doubt whether 'Temperature' is a confounding variable or not."
Data,"Additionally, we see majority of points fall in range of 0 years to 30 years (2)."
MethJust,"Again, we are looking at the relationship between a categorical explanatory variable and a categorical response variable."
Context,The world is a very large place and grows larger every day.
MethDef,"Because the data is very clustered vertically, we might want to perhaps explore the relationship of these variables through a log-transformation of the variable death and see if the plots are easier to analyze."
Data,The data consists of 17 different variables.
Res,"Our analysis led us to the conclusion that there is a negative relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan, meaning that a lower metabolic rate corresponds to a higher lifespan."
Lim,"However, there are limitations to randomness of the data."
RQJust,"Based on recent public outcry for the size of damages awarded, it indicates that the distribution of total damages would be unevenly distributed since some plaintiffs received large amounts of damages while others only received a small amount of damages."
Struct,Table 3 above shows the observed cell counts from the original dataset of 1500 users.
MethJust,"In addition to the air pollutants, we also include measures of time and temperature in our model as we see in EDA that these two variables are correlated with the response variable and measures of air pollution (1)"
Context,"With one of those priceless things being immortality, or the ability to live forever."
Data,"The maximum for midfielders is 563, the maximum for forwards is 321, the maximum for defenders is 402, and the maximum for goalkeepers is 149."
RQDef,We can thus estimate what the mean lifespan is of a Crab-Eating Raccoon should its metabolic rate be 50% lower.
Res,The data shows a wide variation and the boxplots are fairly similar.
Struct,Among this dataset there are a few critical variables.
MethDef,"$Metabolic.by.mass$ is calculated by dividing the resting metabolic rate of the animal subject by its typical body mass, and it allows us to compare animal subjects of different sizes (1)."
RQDef,"Next, we answer other question Preston addresses by looking at crab-eating raccoon data."
MethDef,We can also look at the Median and Mean values to further investigate why our hypothesis is flawed.
RQDef,"Overall, this suggests that there is a relationship between playtime and a player’s position."
Res,"If its metablic rate were 50% smaller, the confidence interval of mean lifespan would be between 18.33647 years and 22.70744 years."
MethDef,"After putting together the models, we use cross validation to determine which model is the best of the two that we have developed."
RQJust,"It may also be the case that pollution may increase or decrease during a particular time of year due any patterns of emissions in Chicago, such as factory output, increased gas usage to heat houses in the winter, or perhaps increased car travel during the summer."
MethJust,"In particular, since both of the variables of interest are right-skewed, we are interested in either a root, logarithmic, or reciprocal transformation of either variable."
Struct,The observations are given below in table 1
Data,"This database contains information from hundreds of scientific papers, for more than 4200 species."
MethJust,This is helpful because the 4-week average line is more resistant to outliers than the raw time series.
Lim,"Therefore, our model could fail to capture some crucial patterns in the data (e.g., how the metabolic rate is related to lifespan within a certain species) (3)."
Lim,There may also be other predictors that we did not account for that could help generate a model with better predictions.
Data,"The sample mean for income is $102,340.00, and the sample standard deviation is approximately $195,774.73."
Lim,"Thus we note that even though this linear model we have fit is satisfactory, we are not satisfied as we would probably want to select some model complex enough to account for these slight discrepancies we noticed in the EDA."
Int,In this case we can say that the relationship between RH and area is reasonably linear with a slightly negative slope.
RQDef,"The analysis on playing time of the 595 players from the 2010 FIFA World Cup gave more insight into how positions affect playing time, the amount of passes made, and how playing time is distributed amongst players."
MethDef,"Because we are looking at two categorical variables, we will use a chi-squared test, which will determine if there is an association between our two variables."
Struct,"In figure 3, we can see the histogram and boxplot for mean temperature (daily and lagged) in Chicago from 1987 to 2000"
Res,"We have a 95% confidence interval of [0.0684,1]."
Int,"Interestingly, we can see a sinusoidal relationship between the 'pm10median' variable and the 'date', as it seems that it may fluctuate for certain seasons, but the correlation between the variables appears to be relatively low, -.165"
Struct,Below is output a table showing the mean and standard deviation of the squared error values from cross validation.
Lim,(2) We couldn't find violations of assumptions or limitations in the data.
Context,"Soccer has been focused around many people’s lives whether it be playing the sport or being a super-fan of it, which makes it not only important as a sport but also important as a way of life."
Data,The distribution is skewed slightly to the right with mean log(death) of 4.744793
Res,"It can be seen that although all countries have outliers, the United States, India, and Canada have the biggest outliers with videos that are over 20 million views above the median which would explain the higher means."
Res,"Because the IQR for the summer months is reasonably greater than the IQR for the colder months, there may be a moderate association between temperature and the moisture content (including humidity) value."
Context,"In this way, it may help environment policy makers and forest rangers to better prevent forest fires and minimize damage."
Data,It is a quantitative variable measuring the number of minutes each player was on the field.
Int,This agrees with that extreme temperature is associated with high mortality.
MethDef,"Where the mus indicate the true means of age in years for the four categories of drug usage frequency: never, sometimes, often, and null."
Data,"The key variables include the date of observation (time), the number of non-accidental deaths on that date (death), median density of a particular matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers pollution in milligrams per cubic meter (pm10median), median concentration of ozone in parts per billion (o3median), median concentration of sulfur dioxide (so2median), and the mean temperature in farenheit (tmpd)"
Other,"In reality, these pollutants' concentrations and densities can not be negative."
Data,Our data is a subset of the AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity.
Other,This is a desirable feature.
Struct,As we move on to multivariate analysis we will be focusing on the 3 variables that we explored in Figure 1 below.
RQDef,We will also examine whether the amount of video uploads has an impact on the success of the channel.
Lim,"Because our analysis hinted at there being several clusters of animals that may need different models fit, we also note that there might not be one blanket model that works best for all the animals -- perhaps several models need to be combined in some way to analyze more groups more efficiently."
RQJust,"When the temperature rises, water absorbs heat energy, lowering the heat of its surroundings, and becomes converted into steam (water vapor)."
MethJust,"Finally, the distribution must be approximately normal."
MethDef,"To test these hypothesis, we run a one sample z-test."
Struct,"To visualize what drug usage attributes to each body type, we observe the bar graph below."
Data,"This dataset contains variables such as metabolic rate, lifespan/longevity , body mass and more for over 300 animals."
RQDef,Based on previous observations we contemplate that most channels have a small number of subscribers (1 million or below).
RQDef,Our first question is going to analyze the distribution of DMC.
Res,"(1) By caculation, the metabolic rate it would have if its rate were 50% smaller is 'r raccoon$metabolic.by.mass'."
Struct,"In figure 3 below, we can now see the updated plots without the outliers from the 1995 Chicago Heat Wave."
RQDef,Our second question will be to analyze if there is any association or correlation between a soccer player’s position and the shots that they attempt within a professional season.
Data,The third and final variable we are considering in this project is drinking.
MethDef,"We will be using 1000 bootstrap iterations to create confidence interval, which comes out ot be [20.22214 22.53236] (3)."
Data,The two remaining variables are 'Temperature' and 'Body.mass.g'.
Data,"It is also noteworthy that $Temperature$ seems to be positively associated with Metabolic.by.mass, which suggests that multicollinearity issue may arise in our model (6)."
Int,There isn't a direct relationship between age and duration and there can be additional variables that affected the data such as the reason for the stay.
MethJust,"Using CLT, we can conclude that this is the case, so we have met all conditions."
MethDef,We want to transform both x and y variables by taking the log.
Lim,"After quantifying the differences between our 6 models, we feel its necessary to note that while our spline model with degrees of freedom = 5 had the lowest estimated MSE of prediction error, there does not seem to be a significant difference between the 5 spline models we created."
MethJust,"We discovered using 5-fold cross validation error for model 1 (using the regular predictors) was 84217.7375, and the error for model 2 (using the average predictors) was 151.9305"
Struct,We will further discuss and analyze why these numbers make sense in the following research portion.
Struct,"For our usage here, the histogram of age (Figure 1) will be added below."
MethDef,"Both models have 4 degrees of freedom for all spline terms, which will be indicated as s()"
MethJust,"Our standard deviations are 2.158 words, 2.050 words, 2.014 words, 2.078 words, 2.149 words, 2.123 words, and 1.863 words, which are all within a factor of 2, so we are able to use ANOVA."
MethDef,"After several trials, we discovered that applying log transformation on all key variables would be the most appropriate method (4)."
Lim,This might mean to eliminating that complexity would lead to a better model fit.
Struct,Figure 2 present a matrix of plots demonstrating the relationship between the response variable and the original explanatory variables (3)
MethJust,"While we have confidence in our lagged GAM being a good fit for the model due to the flexibility from fitting splines for each variable, the plots from Figure 7 show high curvature towards the ends due to less data being available with higher levels of pollutants or temperatures."
Data,"As quantitative proof, the mean of 'log(death)', 4.736 deaths, is equal to its median."
MethDef,"For both models, I am going to use 5-fold cross validation to calculate errors in both models to ensure there is enough data size in each fold for better accuracy."
MethJust,"The mean estimated error (MSE) of model A is 12395.78, and that of model B is 12395.64"
Res,We can also see that there is indeed variation between the means of the subscribers for the categories.
Res,Hypothesis test was conducted to conclude that there is significant statistical evidence to support the model with pollutants over model with only temperature.
Data,"This sample size includes 1500 users, who had active profiles during June of 2012."
Lim,"However, our study was limited in that we could not find a casual relationship between the two."
RQDef,"Our second hypothesis explores the variables of sex and education, and whether one’s sex will influence their educational level."
Data,There are 347 different species and 14 features within our dataset.
Res,"In conclusion, we find, with the help of smoothing spline model and linear model, that the two key variables are negatively related as lifespan increases while metabolic rate decreases (1)."
MethJust,"Also, the residuals are not identically distributed as it contains outliers."
MethJust,"The residual plot for the linear model shows that the residuals appear to be centered around the line of 0, indicating the linearity assumption holds."
Struct,Summary statistics also support our analysis of the above plots.
Lim,"Looking at the plot of our transformed points back in Figure 3, it appears that the cluster of points that we observed in our EDA could potentially be skewing our results in our linear regression."
Context,This examination may provide useful demographics to the company that could help them update their online dating services to improve user experiences.
Data,Africa had the least number of subscribers (1.3% of all subscribers).
RQDef,We do this by analyzing the factors that influence longevity in other animal species.
Res,"After running the hypothesis test, we obtain a p-value of approximately 0."
Int,"This p-value is much smaller than an alpha level 0.05, meaning that the added terms for pollutants do seem to contribute to the model for predicting deaths."
Struct,(See Table 1 Below).
Data,"From the bar chart indicating distribution of month (figure 2), it can be seen that August has a conspicuously large count of forest fire (184 out of 517 forest fires occurred, forming a 35.6%) and that September has a slightly lower count than August (172 out of 517 forest fires occurred, forming a 33.3%)."
Res,Defender seems to have the most total passes while Goalkeeper and Forward seem to have the least amount of total passes.
RQJust,"We knew that these two variables are very similar for measuring moisture content, so it was reasonable to assume there would be a correlation."
Data,"We can see that there is a distinct variation in the mean attempted shots with the forward having the greatest (4.231), with Midfielder having the second greatest but nearly half of the Forward (2.395), followed by the Defender again with about half the mean as the Midfielder (1.165) and the Goalkeeper having the least (.028)."
Context,"Especially in the world that we live in today consisting of growing problems with climate change, it’s imperative that we understand the impacts that humans have on the environment."
MethJust,"For “sometimes”, there are 310 people."
Res,"Since its box plot is also heavily positively skewed, the mean is going to be larger than that."
Res,"The estimated slope, -411.58, suggests that for every year older a person is, they make around $411.58 less on average."
Context,"One social media platform, YouTube, is extremely well known for being expansive across the globe and paying their creators."
Res,"Our model did demostrate, specifically with the crab-eating raccoon, that if the animal had a 50% slower metabolic rate it would be associated with a noticably higher average lifespan."
Data,"Meanwhile, we saw a spike in death rates in 1995 summer, and the pattern between 1988 and 1990 is distinct from other years because of missing data."
Int,This is as many discussion forums receive many varying visitors to learn of many differing topics.
Struct,Figure 4 depicts the histograms of the log-transformed lifespan and metabolic rate variables.
Data,Our research will focus on 4 of these variables.
Data,"This is verified by the scatter plot (which is respectively on cell (3, 2) and (5, 2)) and the weak correlation coefficient (respectively -0.015 and 0.099) between them (5)"
Struct,The matrix below shows the error we estimated for each model in the first row.
MethJust,"This cyclic pattern is very important, and changes how we view the distribution of deaths in Chicago."
Int,"Specifically, nothing implies that intervention in the metabolic processing of a species will have any causal effect on the species' longevity."
MethDef,"We use ANOVA with the null hypothesis that the mean playtime is the same across all positions, hence we will test the hypotheses."
Lim,Our smallest expected cell count is 3.08 (0.008x385) and 4.46 (0.003x1115) between male and female in the married group.
Res,"We get a p-value of approximately 0.0008, which is less than 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a relationship between severity and PatientMDRB."
RQJust,"The initial hypothesis we make is that most fires recorded are of medium size, as large fires are uncommon due to their severity and small ones are too limited in size and duration to be recorded."
Res,"Overall, there are no outliers in this distribution that would skew the data one way or another."
Res,"Since the p-value is less than the generally accepted significance level of alpha, .05, we would reject the null hypothesis."
Other,We can form our formal hypothesis from this idea as well as choose a test.
Int,"Furthermore, people are more likely to read the news or obtain news by other means outside of YouTube."
Struct,"Having examined the univariate distribution of our key variables, we will now examine how the key variables related to each other."
Res,"(3) Using ""resample (X,Y) paris"" with 1000 bootstrap iterations, I get a 95% pivotal confidence interval of (18.33647 years, 22.70744 years)."
Res,"With orange representing women, and blue representing men, we can see that women consistently tend to earn less than men in every income group."
Res,We find that lagged pm10median and lagged o3median seems to overall be increasing but ozone seems to be increasing at a higher rate.
Lim,The residuals appear to be more negative for larger metabolic by mass values.
Data,Our dataset contains 347 observations and 14 variables.
MethJust,We were not concerned about the simplicity of our model as there were no other potential confounders within the dataset that may influence both the metabolic rate and lifespan of animals.
MethDef,"To determine if different positions affect the playing time, an analysis of variance test can be performed."
RQDef,Now we analyzed which covariate is associated the most to death rate through partial response function represented by the Figure 6
Data,"The primary variable of focus for this study is the viewsPerVideo, a quantitative variable that represents the average amount of views that a specific YouTube channel will receive on each video uploaded."
Int,"However, it is important to note that the conclusion from chi-square test do not explain the cause of one variable on another and merely indicates an association between sex and status."
MethDef,"As mentioned in 2.3, since 'death' is a count number, we would use Poisson regression with the log link function."
Res,The slope of the linear regression is 9.7201 and the intercept is 1205.5554.
Res,"The plots reveal that the pollutant that is associated most with mortality is ozone, as the ozone plots show that after a bit of ozone concentration, around 10 parts per billion, we see a huge positive spike, something that isn't seen quite in the other graphs, as some graphs actually have a flatter relationship (4)"
RQDef,"With longer hospital stays, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the claim costs would also increase as the duration of hospital stay increases."
MethJust,"However, when looking at the standard deviations, I found that the standard deviations for the spline models was about a power of 10 smaller than the standard deviation for the linear model."
Lim,"There is also a small possibility of a violation of the Gaussian noise assumption, as there is a little bit of deviation from the straight line in the qq-plot at both ends of the plot."
RQJust,"After all, it seems reasonable to assume that someone in their 40s or 50s might have a more stable career and increased income compared to a person in their 20s, since they have had more time to develop their career."
Res,"However, we noted a lack of linearity between the subscriber count of a channel and views per video."
MethDef,"The first model used the raw observations for each pollutant and temperature covariate, while the second used the lagged versions."
MethJust,"First, the groups must be independent and the samples must be random, which they are."
MethDef,"Therefore, we chose to leave out this variable in our analysis."
RQDef,"Therefore, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the mean age of OkCupid users in San Francisco at the time of data collection is over 30 years old."
Data,"Also notice that in Figure 4, the relationship between lifespan and metabolic by mass seems to be a curve which is concave down."
Data,(3) My repsonse variable is the maximum longevity (lifespan).
Struct,Figure 1 shows the distribution of articles across all channels.
MethDef,"The degrees of freedom of this model is 4007, which is the number of observations in our dataset."
Data,"We can see from our boxplot that the logarithmic number of non-accidental deaths on a specific day is between 4.234 and 6.019, with mean and median values of 4.740 and 4.736 respectively."
MethDef,H0: There is no association between sex and smoking habits (sex and smoking habits are independent).
MethDef,We will use 1000 bootstrap iterations because this is standard practice for many bootstrapping procedures.
Context,"Therefore, it is important to understand if there is a relationship between the way someone drinks and their sex."
Int,"Due to the potential existence of hidden variables that can influence non-accidental deaths and lack of insight on the association between temperature and the pollutants, we believe there's insufficient evidence to convince Mr. Jorgensen to pay for air quality treatments in his environment to reduce mortality."
Res,We can confidently state this because we found the instantaneous model (also known as the individual model) to be a worse fit than the lagged model for our data.
Lim,"A limitation of our report is that because our dataset has us comparing accross a variety of animal species, we arent able to directly state or prove that a decrease in metabolic rate by mass in regard to a particular species would correspond to an increase in mean lifespan of that particular species (3)."
Int,Age seems to affect view count within the SFN threads used within our study.
MethDef,"In order to answer them, we applied transformation to data points in order to interpret them easily in use of modeling."
RQDef,"And (3) If the level of pollution was lowered to match the lowest recorded values, what would the mean death rate be in Chicago on a 70-degree day."
Struct,"Before formally testing the hypothesis, we will compare the differences in proportions between the categorizations within the drug variable among males and females."
Res,Halving this results in a metabolic rate of 0.001115517.
Context,"Rarely, however, have statistical methods been brought to bear on the issue."
Int,"According to the data presented in the frequency bar chart (figure 1), as well as in our frequency table for categories (table 1), our hypothesis cannot be supported."
Data,"Specifically, this dataset contains information on species' lifespan (years), body mass (grams), metabolic rate (watts), body temperature (kelvin), and several taxonomic classifications (i.e., kingdom, class, order, genus, phylum, species) (2)."
Lim,Another assumption that may be broken with additional data is the homoscedasticity and normality assumptions we made when fitting the model.
Struct,We first examine variables individually.
Lim,Future analyses could also see the relationship between views per video and account age.
Lim,This majorly affects our conclusions because the conclusions are contingent on the model being correct and sufficiently modeling the response and that is not the case.
MethJust,The mean prediction error for the first model is 201.5735 and the mean prediction error the second model is 188.0217
Res,We predict that the mean number of deaths on a 70-degree day with those minimum levels of pollutants would be 110.435 deaths.
MethDef,"The alternate model will be the saturated gam model with lag and non-lag variables, and the alternate hypothesis will be that the saturated model is correct (1)"
Lim,"Under this premise, changing the metabolic rate of a crab-eating raccoon would not affect its lifespan as it does not change its dietary habit."
RQJust,"We can see that for the plots of date, pm10median, o3median, and so2median, the relationship between these predictor variables and the response variable death appears to all have a neutral, linear correlation in which the number of deaths doesn't seem to change as we increase the pollutant levels."
Data,"For each of the scatterplots with one of the predictors (three pollutant variables and temperature variable), there doesn't appear to be positive or negative relationship between the predictor and response because each scatterplot demonstrates somewhat of a blob of points with no clear shape."
MethJust,"However, there could be a number of additional factors that could be affecting the data, such as sample size and the number of options to choose from."
MethDef,Figure 3 depicts scatterplots of the lifespan and metabolic rate variables with different combinations of log transformations with a linear regression smoother.
MethDef,Since our assumptions are met we can carry out our two-sample proportion test.
Lim,One problem with the data is that too many claims belong to the ‘other’ category without knowing the exact composition of ‘other’.
RQDef,"From these separate data distributions, the following research scenarios/hypotheses will aim to explore the possible relationships which may exist between sex and drinking, smoking, and drugs habits."
MethJust,"As the difference in LOOCV error (which is around 0.001 to 0.01) between Model 5 and the rest 5 models are much smaller than the standard error (SE) of the models (which is around 0.027), the difference between model 5 (or Model 1.2) and the rest 5 models is not significant in terms of LOOCV error."
Lim,The main one being a confusing amount of options for each individual to choose from within each variable.
Lim,"For example, in education, there were separate options of ‘college/university’ and ‘graduated from college/university’."
MethDef,"Though the violation of homoscedasticity is not severe, we use non-parametric bootstrap for cautious concerns."
MethDef,We tested potential confounding variables in the dataset and determined that a simple model produced the best fit for the data's relationship.
MethJust,"It is important to note, however, that 'Metabolic.by.mass' is linear combination of 'Metabolic.rate' and 'Body.mass.g', and so it would be ""double dipping"" to use 'Metabolic.by.mass' along with either of those two are predictors."
Data,"Furthermore, when breaking it down by the categorical variable of channel category, we notice that the “Comedy” category takes lead with a mean subscriber count of 4,458,965 and standard deviation of 4,552,600."
Lim,"Lastly, this dataset is very outdated and climate change has likely increased the level of pollution and average temperature values drastically just in the last 10 years so these analyses don't tell Preston Jorgensen much about how the relationship between current day pollutants and mortality."
Res,"Finally, if we analyze the spread of the distribution, we can see that the DMC ranges from a DMC of 1.1 all the way to 291.3."
RQJust,The Forward position has a median of 35 total passes and the Goalkeeper position has a median of 52 total passes.
Struct,"With the exploratory data analysis done, we now fit models to the data to investigate patterns between lifespan and metabolic rate."
MethDef,Our null and alternative hypotheses are.
Context,"However, when measuring success in social media, it is often about the number of viewers and shares one gets."
MethJust,"Since the spline model with 3 degrees of freedom had the lowest cross validation mean squared error, we will proceed using the spline model with 3 degrees of freedom."
Res,"As shown by the bar graph above, the Americas are the continent with the greatest amount of channels, with a total of 634."
MethJust,Such that the differences between the prediction errors of the best model versus all the other models (ranging from 0.0002 to 0.0119) are less than the best model's estimated standard error (0.016).
MethDef,"Using bootstrapping, we can make a 95% confidence interval for the value we got to see if its a significant change or not."
MethJust,"A normality plot (figure not shown) confirmed that this transformation had resulted in a more normal distribution, although it was still not perfect (2)."
Int,"Further, we found there to be a reasonably linear relationship between subscriber count and age of accounts on the streaming platform."
Res,"In addition, using our proposed model, we can be 95% confident that the average lifespan of a crab-eating raccoon (_Procyon cancrivorus_, HAGRID = 1898) with a 50% smaller metabolic rate lies between 19.05 and 23.78 years."
Data,"So2median has a minimum of -8.2061, maximum of 28.9034, median of -1.2183, mean of -0.6361, and standard deviation of 2.9262"
RQDef,Our third research question is to see if their is a relationship between categories and views and characterize if there is one present.
Struct,Table 2 above displays the correlation between the two variables: viewsPerVideo and number of subscribers.
Struct,A summary of the number of shots attempted by position as shown in the table below.
MethDef,We will now graphically investigate the relationship between continent and subscribers.
Struct,(4) We use a scatterplot to visualize the relationship.
MethDef,"Also, a new variable 'timeasdate' was created that converts the current date variable into a actual date object for easier use."
Res,"As the output of crab-eating racoon data tells us, the lifespan is 19 years with 0.002231 W/g average metabolic by mass."
Res,"From ANOVA test, the p value is 2.2e-16, which is less than 0.5"
MethDef,We set edf as 4 and used cubic regression splines for all terms.
Data,"The first variable, Time, refers to the date of observation as the number of days before or after December 31, 1993"
Int,"We will instead assume the alternative hypothesis, that the saturated model, with lag variables and non-lag variables, is the correct model."
RQDef,"By exploring the dataset, we expect to identify factors, or more specifically pollutants, that are strongly associated with mortality."
Res,"Consequently, a 95% confidence interval (CI) for our prediction for $death.log$ is [4.637272, 4.713086]"
RQDef,The second research question in our report is whether there is a relationship between total burnt area and the initial spread index.
RQDef,"Additionally, as requested by Jorgensen, we use our model to estimate the mean lifespan of animal with the characteristics of a crab-eating raccoon but with a 50% smaller metabolic rate."
Other,"(3) such, it is important to consider that."
Context,"One such dating app is called OkCupid, and like most dating apps, OkCupid lets their users create their own profile."
MethDef,"Additionally, we can use a hypothesis test for different means."
Data,"All of the unlagged and lagged predictors are unimodal, except for temperature and lagged temperature, which seem to be bimodal."
Context,(1) There are three aspects that he is particularly interested in.
Int,This is likely a result of Simpson's Paradox (5)
MethDef,"We can further investigate the relationships of each channel category based on a box plot that allows for a side-by-side comparison, shown in Figure 2."
RQDef,"Now that we know that there is more of a relationship between channel and title length than the day of publication and title length, we can begin looking at how different channels affect the number of shares received."
Struct,"As we want to do some multivariate EDA, we want to understand more about the relationship between the predictor variables and response variables explored above."
RQDef,"The first question is to determine whether there is evidence that Ozone, Sulfur Dioxide, and Particulate Matter are associated with increased mortality and which of the three pollutants has the strongest association."
Data,This is a continuous variable and will simply be measured by count.
Lim,"Third, we do not have enough data with large values of $SO_2$"
Int,"By calculating the confidence interval for $beta_1$ [-0.60787842, -0.46223086] at significance level $alpha = 0.05$, we are 95% confident that animals with lower metabolic rates have longer lifespans."
Res,"We get a p-value of approximately 0, which is less than 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a relationship between diversity and SampleMDRB."
MethDef,"Let muB, muW, muO, muT, muE, muS, muL represent the true mean number of shares for Business, World, Other, Tech, Entertainment, Social Media, and Lifestyle respectively."
Context,"For example, Ozone and particulate matter in the city's atmosphere is known to cause damage to lungs whereas sulfure dioxide contributes to acid rain in Chicago."
Data,The data collected consists of 517 different forest fires and their respective Fire Weather Index.
Res,"After performing the ANOVA test, we get a test statistic of F = 16.8992 and a p-value that is approximately 0 (p-value = 0)."
MethDef,"After analyzing the residual plot closely and finding that the residuals seem independent of X, we have chosen to resample the residuals for our bootstrap later in the report (6)."
Data,The age of the account in weeks.
Res,"These two counts are between 0 and 50, roughly the same level with counts in the rest of the months."
RQDef,We hypothesize that there will be a linear increase in the proportion of subscriber count relative to account age.
MethJust,"A resampling by cases bootstrap assumes nothing about the distribution of the data or its noise, making it the most conservative approach to determining a confidence interval based on the dataset alone."
Data,The average and median height in the sample is approximately 69 inches with a standard deviation of 3.8 inches (shown in Table 2).
MethDef,"The first model will include the covariates that are not lagged, and the second model will include the covariates that are lagged (averaged over 7 days)"
Lim,"Despite Model 1.2 mitigates some degree of omitted variable bias, unobserved confounding variables may still exist, which means that the true causal relationship could differ from our model estimate(3)."
Data,"Notably, there is positive correlation between 'o3median' and 'tmpd' with correlation coefficient 0.542"
Int,"However, the difference is only +/- 1 death, which is negligible."
Context,(1) While we are far away from ultimately answering immortality we can answer three following questions about factors relating to lifespan.
MethDef,"Our best model is a Poission GAM model with a log-link using only the lagged averaged variables as predictors, as well as time."
MethDef,A linear regression line is also modeled to help identify and characterize the relationship.
MethDef,"Now that we have fitted our two Poisson models, one with lagged and one without lagged air pollutant variables, we want to use cross-validation to determine which of our two models fit our Chicago data better, in terms of prediction error."
Other,"Lastly, we must have sufficient size for each expected cell-count (at least 5)."
Res,"None of the plots in any section have a very clear trend, for the pollutants, and although there was a difference in models, or stronger association between variables, this does not tell us that the association is strong in general and should be treated as a possible cause of, or correlation to, mortality."
MethJust,"Based on this information, we will pick the second model for the results because it has a slightly better standard of error and it has a more significantly better cross-validation error (3)"
MethDef,"5-fold cross validation will also be used to determine which of the models fit best to the data, in terms of prediction error."
Data,"Diagnosis is a categorical variable and describes what the reason for each patient’s liver transplant was: AIH = autoimmune hepatitis, ARLD = alcohol-related liver disease, BILIARY = biliary complications, HBV = hepatitis B, HCV = hepatitis C, NAFLD = non-alcoholic fatty liver disease."
Context,Is it possible for humankind to achieve immortality.
MethJust,This suggests that the residuals are normally distributed.
Data,We notice this with the heavy concentration of little passes made but then there are fewer numbers of many passes made.
Context,"Overall, we should be aware of the limitations of our model and seek out more data to make better conclusions on the association between atmospheric pollutants and mortality."
Data,"It contains general information about an animal, including lifespan, age of sexual maturity, adult body mass, typical body temperature, and metabolic rate."
Int,"As mentioned before, the effect of pollution appears to extend over time, as seen by our proof of our lagged GAM performing better than our non-lagged GAM"
Data,Age varied for each user from 18 to 65.
Data,The above variables are the covariates in our research.
Res,We also learned that videos posted in India and Great-Britain gain the similar amount of videos on average as videos from the United States.
MethDef,"Regarding status, users that indicated “sometimes” and “often” are considered to be drug users."
MethJust,But the estimated standard errors are all around 0.03.
MethJust,"Meanwhile, the data does not follow the assumption of Model A very well."
Res,"From this graph, we can see that animals with lower metabolic rates also tend to have longer lifespans."
Context,"Each video collects views from every person that watches the video, thus increasing the popularity of the video allowing it to possible trend, and become even more popular."
Data,A boxplot we analyzed but chose not to display showed that there are some possible outliers for values greater than 302 Kelvin.
MethDef,"Therefore, we apply log transformation to make the graph more clear to understand, so that we can see the relationship of the two variables more clearly In order to apply log transformation to the two variables, we will create two new variables in our dataset called 'Log.max.Longevity', which are values of logarithm applied to 'Maximum.longevity.yrs', and 'Log.Metabolic.by.mass', which are values of logarithm applied to 'Metabolic.by.mass'."
Res,From the two tables above it can be seen that the subscriber coefficient is .3172.
Struct,(2) We will now explore the relationship between our predictors and our response.
Lim,"First of all, we do not know, from this data or analysis, whether or not pollutants are just a confounding variable."
Context,The idea of immortality is something that has long been captivating idea for humans.
Struct,The table above shows the result from the cross validation.
Context,"Soccer is the most popular sport in the world, with an impressive 4 billion fans, almost twice as much as the second most popular sport, Cricket (as reported by World Atlas, Oct 16, 2020: https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-are-the-most-popular-sports-in-the-world.html)."
MethDef,Our null and alternative hypotheses are.
MethJust,"Because we only know the temperature on the day is 70 F, which is not a lagged value, we used model A to make the prediction."
Lim,(More data is needed in order to completely prove or disprove this point.).
Data,This data contains the information of all 595 players who appeared in the 2010 World Cup games before the final.
Context,A prime example of this is dating sites.
Context,"With the advent of platforms like OkCupid and Tinder, a person seeking a romantic partner no longer needs to frequently spend time at bars or ask friends to set up blind dates."
MethDef,Alternate Hypothesis (HA): At Least one Mean not Equal.
Lim,"Also, the size of the dataset is relatively small."
Int,"Furthermore, it makes sense that effects of pollutants over time is better estimate for death compared to single-day pollutant data."
Int,There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is an association between sex and relationship status of users.
Lim,"For this study, we would have appreciated data being collected from more sources (to avoid bias from one sample station), data from several forests around the globe, and for data to have been collected from a longer period of time."
MethJust,"Although model B works better, but we think model A should be more appropriate to accurately address Jorgensen's request."
Lim,This indicates a possible violation of the constant variance assumption.
MethDef,Alternate Hypothesis (HA): At Least one Mean not Equal.
MethDef,"In order to answer this question, we created Figure 9, where we plotted the points of log(Maximum.longevity.yrs) vs log(Metabolic.by.mass) and then fit our chosen model (smoothing spline with degrees of freedom = 5)."
MethJust,"The normality plots and the boxplots (not shown) show us fewer outliers and better alignment, so the transformations were successful."
Data,"Although our explanatory variables seem to be related to $Class$, $Class$ does not seem to be related to the response variable."
Int,"(We could assume that because a more significant number of people listen to music every day, compared to the number of people who play video games, this dispute could make sense.)."
Res,"Throughout the report below, we did find significance between certain models but none of them allowed us to confidently conclude that the pollutants were significantly correlated with number of deaths."
Data,"Given in-depth information from the data file 'chicago.csv', which contains data of 5114 observations of Chicago's air quality through 6 relevant variables: time (date of observation), death (number of non-accidental deaths on that date), pm10median (median density of $PM_{10}$ pollution), o3median (median concentration of ozone, parts per billion), so2median (median concentration of sulfur dioxide), and tmpd (mean temperature, Farenheit)"
Context,"Biological researchers around the world have devoted countless hours to better understanding what factors effect lifespan, and furthur how we can influence those factors to slow the aging process and prolong life."
MethJust,Females: (385)(0.091) = 35 ≥ 10 (385)(1- 0.091) = 345 ≥ 10.
Lim,"Our data only contains data on 3 kinds of pollutants, which means our model does not capture the effect of other pollutants on mortality (3)"
Data,"This indicates that they are not normally distributed, despite both PM10 and sulfur dioxide both being unimodal."
Data,"(1) As can be seen in figure 1, the metabolic rate for most species is roughly the same, with only a few outliers."
Lim,"As such, the model does not appear to fit very well."
Res,Further testing with cross-validation with 5 fold revealed that the model with lagged variables perform better than the model with original variable based on MSE
MethJust,The difference doesnt seem significant as the difference in estimated MSE of prediction error values are within 1 standard error of each other for all 5 spline models (5).
Struct,"First, let's take a look at some univariate EDA, or boxplots of our key variables."
RQDef,Our next research question is to look into whether mean playtime of players is associated with the position of the player.
Struct,"Below in Figure 3, we see residuals plots and a qq-plot of the residuals."
Context,"Research has shown that on average, men tend to drink and smoke more, and use more drugs."
MethJust,"However, the large majority of residuals look normal enough that we can still proceed."
RQDef,"Having proved that our model fits better than the null model, we also want to assess whether pollution is an important factor in our final model."
Data,"As seen above, we also have plotted log of death over time, and this might help us identify possible outliers of specific events or dates that could affect or bias our model later on, and in our case, we see three dates, 1995-07-14, 1995-07-15, and 1995-07-16 showing signs of outlying data."
Context,This work may help adults and adolescents who want to share a passion they have with the world but don’t know the necessary knowledge to see if they can bring in a large following.
Int,"Additionally, our model indicated that the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan is nonlinear."
RQJust,"From the histogram above, we can see that the majority of the players take 3 or fewer shots, and we can test the following."
MethDef,We first constructed a linear model to fit to the data (1).
MethDef,"Additionally, we can use a hypothesis test for different means."
RQJust,"The decreased variation in these lag-variables indicate that they may be better for modeling than their original counterparts, and they also show clearer relationships (or lack there of) with our desired response, log-deaths."
Res,"However, we see in figure 5 that the SE of $SO_2$'s effect seems to be very large, which may indicate that $SO_2$ may not be a significant predictor of mortality."
MethDef,"In Table 1 shown above, we calculated the Mean and the Median values for subscriber count of each of the 9 categories that we are studying."
Data,There are 6 missing datapoints.
Data,"Education is a categorical variable that assesses the education level of the OkCupid user, with twenty-eight options to summarize their educational experience."
Int,Thus we can conclude that there is evidence that that the three pollutants are statistically significantly associated with increased mortality.
Res,"We noticed that the two confidence intervals are different, where the one obtained from bootstrapping is wider."
MethDef,"To allow comparions between animals of different sizes, we create a new variable 'Metabolic.by.mass', the amount of energy used per unit of body mass by dividing 'Metabolic.rate' by 'Body.mass.g', in Watts per gram."
Res,"By bootstrapping, we conclude that a 95% pivotal CI for $death.log$ in a setting described above is [4.632680, 4.721169] (6)"
Data,The data used in this project comes from a website titled ScienceForums.Net (SFN).
MethJust,"However, based on the uncertainty in your estimates of the prediction error, the difference between models does not seem very significant (for the spline models only)."
Other,"To understand the structure of these relationships and how they influence our results, we will need to rely most heavily on their contributions and interactions in our potential models."
Res,The Chi-squared test returns an X-squared value of 158.35 and a p-value < 2.2e-16 < 0.05.
MethDef,"However, for now, we can combine the people who said “sometimes” and “often” under the same group of people who are drug users, so we can move on with the ANOVA test."
Data,There also appears to be a positive nonlinear relationship between temperature and 'Metabolic.by.mass'.
Lim,There were only 517 forest fires utilized within this study.
Struct,Figure 8 shows us deaths and log of deaths over time (1987 to 2000)
Data,Looking at pm10median’s histogram we can see it is unimodal with a right skewed shape.
MethDef,"To determine the performance and how well each model fits the data, we will use 5-fold cross validation."
Context,Content creators can use this conclusion to understand what videos to make if they hope to gain high views.
Data,"Since it is a variable measuring time, it is clear that it follows the uniform distribution with the mean 0 (1)"
Lim,One limitation we must be aware of is that the data we analyzed was observational data and that we did not actively create an experiment.
Data,The data used for this report was scraped from the OkCupid site and was sampled from 1500 San Francisco users.
Data,"We can see that the median concentration of ozone pollution, or 'o3median', (parts per billion) falls between -24.779 and 43.688, with mean and median values of -2.179 and -3.326"
MethJust,"However, the relationship between $Max.lifespan$ and $Metabolic.by.mass$ does not seem to be linear, which implies the need for transformation (6)."
Res,"According to Table 2, plaintiffs that claim fraud tend to have higher total damages in average compared to other types of claim."
Data,"The number of shares received and the number of words in the title is measured by count, where the count is greater than or equal to zero."
Data,"The negative relationship between the response variable and $Metabolic.by.mass$ is further confirmed by the negative correlation coefficient between them, which is -0.385."
Int,"Logically, this makes sense since the negative effects of pollution tend to manifest after continued exposure."
Data,"We note that there are several y-axis outliers, where several users report income of $1,000,000, about 2 users that report an income of $500,000, and several report an income of a little more that $200,000."
Int,"Just taking that into consideration, since the average views for both categories are so close together, both are a safe bet for content creators trying to create videos that gain high views."
MethJust,"After the transformation, as shown in Figure 4, the relationship appears to be moderately linear."
MethJust,"Now, we see the data points are spread out which makes easier for us to find the relationship."
RQDef,"In this study, we examined the relationship between a soccer player’s position and their statistics in terms of their playtime, shots attempted, and total passes."
Struct,Below are some graphs displaying the general spread of account age in this dataset.
MethDef,"Now, we will remove the datapoints with NA in it so when we start to do transformations and models, we will have variables with all values and no NA"
Res,"However, after calculating correlation, we find that there is only a -0.076 linear correlation between RH and area."
Data,"Our sample mean is approximately 33 years, and our sample standard deviation is approximately 10 years."
Data,"Our investigation looked at three different variables of age, height, and sex and their relation to status."
Context,"Taking all of this information into account, we will make a recommendation as to whether or not you should spend your wealth in efforts to reduce pollution by that amount."
Int,"This signifies that if there is a linear correlation, it is a very weak negative linear relationship."
Data,"When Examining the death rate over time in Chicago, there were apparent outliers around 1995 shown by the Figure4 below."
Struct,One variable we mentioned in the data section but since paid very little attention to is time.
Data,The variable shots attempted is also a quantitative variable that shows the number of attempts a player shot the ball to the opposing goal.
Lim,Future studies can investigate forest fires within a more globalized range and use more diverse variables along with more summary measures.
Res,"(1) Judging by the plot of the fitted spline model with 3 effective degrees of freedom on top of the AnAge data, having lower metabolic rate does seem to predict a higher longevity on average."
Int,This is not necessarily the case for news or politic videos.
Other,"Since all three’s medians are so close, we can assume their means will be as well."
Lim,They should first try to randomly sample individuals.
Int,"Because the p-value is less than the threshold of .05, we can reject the null hypothesis and say that there exists a relationship between smoking and body type."
Int,It is only a specific few which undergo the correct conditions for a transformation into a severe blaze capable of causing significant damage.
Int,"Eventually, between RH and area, we discovered a linear relationship with slightly negative slope."
RQJust,"We can see that most samples with a SampleMDRB of 0, indicating no MDRB in the sample stool, have a diversity score of at least 2.7761, while half of samples with SampleMDRB of 1, indicating that there was MDRB in the sample stool, have a diversity score of less than 2.6055."
RQDef,We hypothesize that there is a relationship between a player’s position and their shots attempted.
Res,"From the scatterplot displayed below, there is no clear relation between the number of video uploads and the number of subscribers a channel has."
RQDef,"Because we have reason to believe the majority of users are over age 30, we will test the following hypothesis."
MethJust,"From the residuals plot, we can see that the residuals are nicely centered around 0 and spreaded evenly out without clear pattern."
Struct,"After exploring each individual variables, we want to take a look at the relationship between the two."
Data,Our research questions also includes Countries and Subscribers.
RQDef,The target audience then may be correlated to video view count which we further look into through Table 1.
Data,Income is a quantitative variable that measures a persons income in US $.
Data,Some users preferred not to indicate their drug usage.
MethDef,"Specifically, I fit five models."
MethJust,"All standard deviations are within a factor of 2, meaning they are so sufficiently close to use ANOVA."
Context,Creators are those who produce content and get paid for it.
RQJust,"In the scatterplot (below), we see that views seems to grow with posts."
Lim,"Also, it should use a dataset that measures the lifespan of every individual subject."
Res,"If the average air pollution in the past 7 days is at the minimal level (in the historical record) and the average median temperature is 70 degrees Fahrenheit, the expected mortality in Chicago will be about 107.25 people on 30 December 2000, according to our model."
MethDef,"As no assumptions are severely violated for Model 1.2 (see $Appendix$), we could directly use the p-value (which is 0.0401) returned by the regression output."
MethJust,"(2) Since we will be exploring the relationship between unit metabolic rate and lifespan, we try to plot the histograms for 'Metabolic.by.mass' and 'Maximum.longevity.yrs'."
MethDef,"To get a preliminary understanding of our data, we created a contingency table between sex and status (shown in Table 5)."
Int,"Therefore, we conclude that there is significant evidence that income varies according to one’s sex."
Res,We know this because our chosen model fits better than an instantaneous model.
Struct,"In order to use this test, several conditions must be met."
Res,"From the Bar Chart shown above, we can see that the United States does indeed hold the greatest amount of channels in all the categories, except for the Music Category: which is dominated by India."
Res,"Those in the Music and Gaming category also had a smaller standard deviation when compared to other categories, determining that it is more consistent in viewsPerVideo across accounts."
Res,We were able to estimate a general expected death toll for any particular day being 114 to about 115 people with 95% confidence.
Data,"The variable drinks is another categorical variable describing how often a user drinks (desperately, not at all, often, rarely, socially, very often)."
MethDef,"Rather, we should use a resampling of cases approach which only makes the assumption that the response (log of deaths) and predictor (lagged pollutants and temperature) variables are independent and identically distributed random variables."
MethJust,"We decided only to analyze the distribution of these three quantitative variables, because the other two quantitative variables, body.mass.g and metabolic.rate are both taken into consideration in the variable we created metabolic.by.mass."
Context,"Although immortality may be out of reach with present technologies, this has not stopped billionaire Preston Jorgensen's interest in finding ways to extend his life."
Res,"Upon running this test, we get a p-value of 0."
Data,"It also includes categorical variables including a unique ID for each animal (HAGRID), the common name, and the taxonomic classification."
Int,"However, we still expect both models to depict an inverse relationship between metabolic rates and lifespans across animals and also both models will use this log-log transformation (6)."
Res,"As we can see in Figure 6, seen below, the majority of individuals who have graduated from college/university have been male."
Data,"The same holds true for its 7 day average variable, lag_pm10median."
Struct,"In order to use the one-way ANOVA test, we have to make sure of several things first."
Res,"The data is heavily right-skewed and with a short right tail, appears as though relatively-medium-sized wildfires are uncommon, and large fires are even rarer."
Data,"In our least count category, we have Social Media and Lifestyle, and that category contains 250 articles to 350 articles."
MethDef,"To keep the modelling simple, we have used spline smoother terms for all the variables and set the degrees of freedom to be 4 for all."
MethJust,"We observe that the model we chose performs about 3% better than the worst model, indicating the difference between the models are not significant (5)."
Lim,Some limitations in this data is that we do not know more about the team sizes.
MethDef,We filtered observations in this dataset to exclude days with missing data for any variables (including lagged variables)
MethJust,"Since the playtime data is continuous, the data follows a normal distribution since the size of the sample of players is greater than or equal to 30, the players can be picked at random, and the population standard deviation is known, the z test is justifiable to use."
Int,"We find that pivotal bootstrapping tends to give wider confidence intervals primarily since the bootstrapping method we used is the ""resampling cases"" method which involves less assumptions (7)"
RQDef,Question 1: Is the mean of the number of shots taken less than 3.
RQDef,"The next research question we will investigate is whether the location of the channel origin affects the number of subscribers it has, if there is an association, we will characterize it."
MethJust,"(6) Based on our diagnostics plots, we have no problem with the normality assumption for our model, however we have a problem with our constant variance assumption."
RQDef,Preston Jorgensen would like to know from research if there is any factors that appear to be related to lifespan to attain immortality.
MethJust,"Due to the requirement of this report, we will NOT consider Model 1.2 to be a candidate for our final model, but we will use it to gain some insight into the causal relationship between $Metabolic.log$ and $Age.log$."
Context,Youtube is a platform that thrives on diverse content.
Data,Death is a numerical quantity reporting how many non-accidental deaths occured on that date.
RQDef,"I can figure out if there’s a relationship between subscribers and viewsPerVideo, relationship between subscribers and accountAge, and relationship between subscribers and videoUploads."
Other,"As we are constructing our regression models, we remember to choose the one that is the most accurate and interpretable in order to best explain patterns in the data."
Lim,"As for limitations in our analysis, I believe that there are potential confounders unaccounted for in the AnAge database that impact animal lifespans."
RQDef,It would make sense to hypothesize that the more subscribers a Youtuber has the more viewsPerVideo they get on average as they have more viewers that they know are interested in their content.
Res,"Here, we can see that the proportion of overweight non-smokers to total overweight individuals is greater than the proportion of fit non-smokers to total fit individuals."
MethJust,"Based on the cross-validation results in the previous section, we have determined that Model 2 is the best model for the data."
MethJust,"Additionally, the estimated standard error for the linear model is approximately 0.0008, which is much lower than the standard errors of all the spline models (as is seen in table 1)."
MethJust,"Other than this minor deviation, our model met all the assumptions necessary and appears to fit well (4)."
RQDef,Our formal hypotheses are.
MethDef,A nonparametric model such as the smoothing spline might be a good option.
Int,"Our findings also indicate that air pollutants have effects over time, and are not just instantaneous."
Res,"Using our model, we also predicted with 95% confidence that if average weekly pollutants are at their lowest for a summer day, we expect only about 100 to 108 people to die."
Context,"The social media platform, YouTube, has grown significantly since it’s creation in 2005."
MethDef,We conducted a deviance test that compares Model Lag_tmpd with Model B
MethJust,"Our EDA showed us this was the best variable to predict the longevity, and so we fit our models using solely that variable."
Int,"However, we did not prove causation, i.e. high or low concentrations of pollutants in a day ""cause"" a certain number of deaths"
MethJust,"The corresponding 'temperature' values for these dates were 91.5 degrees F, 86.0 degrees F, 83.0 degrees F, and 78.5 degrees F, which aren't even the highest temperature values in this dataset."
RQDef,The third question is to analyze whether there is an association between drug use and age.
MethJust,"This is because we want to make comparisons between different animals, and measuring the amount of energy consumed per unit of body mass makes for a better comparison."
Data,"In order to estimate its life span if its metabolic rate was 50% lower, we have to start by obtaining its base metabolic rate, which is 2.588 Watts."
Context,"During the heat wave, temperatures soared to 106 degrees Fahrenheit and many elderly poor residents who could not afford air conditioning died."
Data,"The quantitative variable RH (relative humidity in %) has a mean of 44.288, a range of 85, and a standard deviation of 16.317."
Int,"Because this p-value is smaller than the significance level of alpha=0.05, we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, that there is no relationship between the variable drugs and age, and have evidence for the alternative hypothesis, that there is a relationship between drugs and age."
Lim,Including these variables in my regression models may have led to different model selections and would have better identified the true relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan (3).
Data,Another thing we observe is that the interquartile ranges for all positions is between 0 and 200 total passes.
Res,"The p-value of our test is 0, which means there is significant evidence to reject Model B in favor of the saturated model."
Data,"Furthermore, there seem to be a smaller concentration of users after age 50 in the graph."
Int,— suggesting that the monitoring equipment is sensitive enough to measure wildfires which burn an area of less than 0.1 ha.
Struct,These models (shown below) were used to answer the questions that Jorgensen asked of us.
Int,"Therefore, we conclude that Model 2 fits better than Model 3, and the associations between mortality and air pollution is jointly significant (2)"
Int,"Especially, the most associated pollutant with death appears to be Ozone."
Struct,"Before we start modeling the data, it is important to analyze the variables we are working with."
MethJust,"From Figure 1, we can see that the response variable, death, along with the key predictor variables, are all skewed to the right."
Data,Entertainment has by far the most channels.
MethDef,"Firstly, we start with mapping a scatterplot with ISI as the x-axis and area as the y-axis."
RQDef,(5) We are interested in the expected number of deaths if pollution is at its lowest.
Struct,"As in our first two research scenarios, we assess our hypotheses with a formal inference for contingency tables."
Data,The median number of non-accidental deaths was 114 in this dataset.
Struct,(5) Table 3 shows the smallest value observed for each lagged pollutant variable.
Res,The linear fit is horizontal as well.
Struct,(3) We now explore diagnostic plot for both linear and spline models.
Struct,All of the formal conditions that must be met in order to use the Chi-Square Test have been discussed and justified in the first research question.
Context,"In addition, the number of subscribers can differ from one continent to another."
Data,"The overlaid density curve shows a long right tail, and this is due to a number of potential outliers."
Int,"However, the latter is more plausible as models using lagged variables yield slightly better performance, and this explanation is more consistent with commonsense."
Data,The distribution of age is left-skewed with a unimodal distribution.
Lim,"For (1), the dataset we used for our research is over two decades old."
Data,The dataset contains 5114 daily observations of six variables.
MethDef,(1) We start by examining a simple linear model: $$Lifespan = beta_0 + beta_1(Metabolic Rate)$$.
Lim,"However, there may be some heteroskedasticity such that residuals for larger values of the log of metabolic rate are mostly negative."
Res,"Then, the logged value of lifespan comes out to be 21.34173 years after we get rid of log from the result (2)."
Res,"However, the shape of the plot seems not very linear with a correlation of -0.059."
Res,"From these numbers, we can see that there is a lot of variation between the continents in the number of subscribers."
Data,"We created a basic plot of Lifespan vs Metabolic Rate (Figure 3) (5) and noted that there appears to be a negative relationship that looks approximately linear on the right side, but seems to flatten out a bit more towards the left."
Res,"Beginning with the all-categories piechart (figure 1, below), we see that most of the channels in this study were entertainment-based and were followed by music."
Data,The response variable is the death rate each day in Chicago(2)
Lim,Another possible impact to our conclusions was the inital data cleaning that was done to remove rows with any missing column values (NAs)
Data,The first is our response variable: Lifespan.
Context,This question will help us understand which country’s videos do better on the platform.
Lim,"For (2), we noted in the EDA section that 'temperature' appears to be strongly correlated with $PM_{10}$ and $O_3$"
Int,We cannot conclude that there’s is a relationship between costs and age as the plot isn’t very linear.
Struct,"With that mind, we think we can do somewhat better."
Lim,"On the other hand, the log transformation of the temperature variable didnt result in much improvement of the shape of the histogram or normality of the distribution as the distribution still has a distinct left skew."
Data,"(2) To analyze these questions, I use a dataset that provides air quality measurements and non-accidental death number in Chicago each day from January 1987 to the end of December 2000"
Struct,We will mainly use $date$ in EDA and use $time$ in model-building.
MethDef,"As a result, we decided to accept it as the condition of 5 is only slightly violated and proceed with the chi-square test."
Res,To further support this analyis we can look back to the simple linear regression we performed earlier that showed a significant negative coefficient on metabolism predicting longevity.
MethJust,"Although these violations result from very few outliers, which means the results may not be fundamentally biased if we use re-sample residuals, we will use non-parametric bootstrap (re-sample cases) for cautious concerns (6)"
MethDef,MU is the average playtime of players in the 2010 world Cup in minutes.
Struct,Below is the scatterplot and the associated regression line for the relationship between the shots attempted and the play time of the soccer players.
RQDef,We hypothesize that there will be an association between sex and drug habits.
Int,"Aside from that, we can see that the relationship appears sufficiently linear as the regression model is linear and the correlation coefficient is reasonably appropriate, we can then include the intercept and slope of the above regression as well as the correlation coefficients summarized in the tables below."
RQJust,We can observe from this table that males have higher proportions within every single drinking category.
Data,We also see that $Max.lifespan$ seems to be positively associated with $Temperature$ (6).
Lim,There was not enough data to account for younger subscribers to provide an accurate reading of the relationship between age and costs and age and duration.
Int,"From here, we can reject the null hypothesis to find there is a relationship between drinking and body type and move on to examining the contingency table to find further connections between drinking and body type."
Struct,Now we will move on to some multivariate EDA to explore the relationship between predictors and response variable.
Res,"In table 2 below, we can see the confidence interval results: Comparing the two confidence intervals, we can see that the predict function estimates the number of deaths for the lowest pollutant values on a 70-degree day to be between 104 and 120 deaths."
RQDef,"In conclusion, our study shows how drug usage is related to many factors, such as age, income, and relationship status."
Lim,This is a minor violation of the homoskedasticity assumption.
Int,"Therefore, there is more of an audience for these categories than someone wanting to join the sports category, which has the fewest channels and therefore would probably have high entry barriers."
MethDef,"For a more formal analysis on which model fits the data better, we will conduct a 5-fold cross-validation to determine which of our two models fits best to the data in terms of prediction error."
Data,"The dataset included other variables such as the kingdom of the species and their typical body temperature, but we did not identify them as necessary explanatory or confounding variables for our analysis."
Data,Boxplots were also made (figure not shown) for both death and log-transformed death which supports our previous answers in which it displays a normal distribution with a few outliers for high values of death.
MethJust,"(4) It is worth noting that during preliminary analysis, assessing the inverse of lifespan versus logarithmic-transformed metabolic rate per unit body mass seems to reveal a possible nonlinear relationship between the two variables (shown in figure 9), and during this report this possibility will be tested using nonparametric modeling to check if a nonlinear fit is more appropriate."
MethDef,Our model controls for time.
MethDef,Ha: beta1<0.
Lim,"Further, we may want to analyze total views in order to figure out whether their viewsPerVideo average was thrown off by a video that was more or less popular than the others."
MethDef,"Using R, we find out that $beta_{0}$ has value of 0.1492 and $beta_{1}$ has value of -0.39993."
MethDef,"Next, we will fit a model that only encompasses the temperature part of our second model, which only utilizes lag variables, and compare the temperature only model to the second model."
Data,"Right now, the raccoon has a lifespan of 19 years."
MethJust,"However, we found that the distribution of data in each taxonomic class was highly variable, which would prevent us from obtaining meaningful results."
Struct,The resulting errors are summarized in Table 1.
Context,Dating apps have become a primary and easy mode of finding desirable qualities within the people around us and seeking out partners.
MethJust,"As a non parametric bootstrap, there are no assumptions except that the observations are independent of one another."
MethDef,"Respectively, Let msaG, msaD, msaM, and msaF represent the true mean shots attempted for each position."
MethJust,"We also bootstrapped 1000 samples using the ""resampling cases"" method since the assumptions about the generalized additive models are naturally weak since we are using nonlinear smoothing functions and bootstrapping using this method would lead to more confident predictions (6)"
Data,"Out of 14 these variables, 'X', 'HAGRID', 'Maximum.longevity.yrs', 'Body.mass.g', 'Metabolic.rate', and 'Temperature' are continuous variables, while 'Kingdom', 'Phylum', 'Class', 'Order', 'Family', 'Genus', 'Species', and 'Common.name' are categorical variables."
Struct,Next we decided to create a QQ Plot to better understand the normality of the data.
RQDef,"It seems reasonable to think that the older one gets, the more money they tend to make."
MethJust,"Looking at Figure 8, we can see that the tails of the QQnorm line deviate from the straight line, indicating that our model may have some issues with normality."
Context,We pay a monthly premium that pays for the health care benefits under the insurance.
Int,"Keep in mind we cannot say that reducing pollutants would ""cause"" mortality to decrease since we are working with observational data, but it seems that reducing pollutants does not seem to correlate with reduced death rate (2)"
MethDef,"After constructing our two generalized additive models, we evaluated the prediction error of each model using 5-fold cross-validation to determine which model fits the data better."
MethDef,Then we model a linear regression line to observe the possible linear relationship between the two quantitative variables.
MethJust,"For “never”, there are 961 people."
MethJust,"By including the 'lag_tmpd' or 'tmpd' variable in the model, which seems to be a good decision due to the strong correlation we found it to have with deaths."
Data,"The same can be said with ozone and PM10, but the relationship is less clear than the latter."
MethDef,"We chose to use the pivotal confidence interval because asymptomatically it will have about 95% coverage, which is what we want."
MethDef,"In addition to Figure 3, we will assess our hypothesis with a formal hypothesis test using a one-way ANOVA test."
MethJust,The mean squared error for model 1 and model 2 were each 201.17 and 189.31
RQJust,We can see that the greatest difference between female and male is 0.031 in the seeing someone status.
Data,"The data contains information for 347 animals, specifically from the Chordata phylum, or animals that have a spinal cord."
Data,"To formulate this hypothesis, we will need to focus on the mean total passes for each position."
Int,"We concluded that there exists a true, positive relationship between death rate and the 7-day averages of the pollutants and temperature to predict death rate, which indicates that the effect of pollution on death rate is likely extended over several days, meaning that as these averages increased, there is evidence that death rate increased as well."
Res,"In this case, that would reduce its 'Metabolic.by.mass' from 0.0022 to 0.0011."
Lim,"We can see from figure 4 that while the clustering is tighter and more distinct in the untransformed temperature data, there is still noticeable clustering of data points near the top of the graphs including the log transformed temperature data."
RQDef,"(iii) if a crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate is reduced by 50%, with all the other characteristics stay the same, its mean lifespan my model would etimate."
Data,The sample used for this study contains all players that appeared within the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
Res,"(2) Using our selected model, we would estimate its mean lifespan with those characteristics to be 20.78 in years."
Int,Figure 1 shows a negative association between cost and age.
RQJust,We can see that the Midfielder and Defender positions tend to make more passes than the other two positions.
Res,"With the z test we get a test statistic of z=1.4867, and the the p value of this statistic is 0.9314, which is nearly 1."
MethJust,The conditions for inference are mostly satisfied as our data is randomly pulled by the computer with a sample size greater than 30.
Int,"From this, we can conclude that there is sufficient evidence of an association between drug usage and relationship status."
Int,"Based on these results, I would say that ozone appears to be most associated with death rate (4)"
RQDef,Our next research question investigates whether the average number of shots has an association with a player’s position.
MethDef,"(2) Then we create five more sophisticated, spline models with effective degrees of freedom values ranging from 3 to 7, inclusive."
MethJust,"Based on the residual plot, the residuals appear to have a random spread approximately centered about zero."
Res,"From the second plot in figure 5, we see that mortality first increases then decreases from 1987 to 2000"
Struct,We began our analysis by plotting a histogram of Metabolic Rate to get an idea of its distribution (Figure 1 left).
RQDef,"So, the hypothesized shape for the distribution would be non-symmetric and skewed."
MethJust,"From our EDA, we saw that the relationships between our predictors and response don't appear to be linear, thereby making GAMs more ideal for our analysis."
Lim,"To better explain the bending downwards trend in the data, a nonparametric model such as smoothing spline would be more desired than a simple linear regression model."
Data,The data for this project was gathered via a volunteered sample from San Francisco OKCupid Users.
MethJust,"Thus, we have no evidence to conclude that the relationship between $Metabolic.log$ and $Age.log$ is not linear."
MethJust,"In other words, there is enough evidence to support that 'Temperature' is a confounding variable at signifance level $alpha = 0.05$."
MethDef,"We will use spline smoother terms for all variables, and for simplicity and speed, we will use 4 degrees of freedom for all spline terms (1)"
MethJust,(5) The difference between the models does not appear significant.
Res,We also found that a 50% reduction in the metabolic rate for the crab-eating raccoon would yield an average lifespan between 18.6 and 23 years (3).
Data,The dataset provides information up until the end of 2018 for 1259 Youtube channels.
Struct,"Since we have confirmed our model works well and that these pollutants do have an association with the number of non accidental deaths, we can now analyze the impact timeframe."
Data,"The mean viewsPerVideo is 2,960,682 with a standard deviation of 8,332,162 viewsPerVideo."
MethDef,We will be creating five models with effective degrees of freedom being 3 to 7 (2).
Int,"However, the further we look at the data, we can affirm Music is the more successful category."
MethDef,This observation alone indicates that time should somehow be used as a predictor in our model.
RQJust,"For example, corporate careers have more opportunities for growth than a high school teaching career."
Data,"Looking at figure 2 below, we find that the death over time graph seems to have outliers with a high number of deaths near a range of dates."
Data,The data is collected from the National Center for State Courts and is later used by the Bureau of Statistics for analysis.
Context,Prolonging mortality is a goal much of humanity has.
Context,"Eventually, this report may help policy makers and rangers to better prevent and control forest fires, thus avoiding loss due to forest fires."
Lim,Including more animals from a wider range may offer more insight.
Lim,"However, there does not appear to be a very even or constant spread about the line of 0, indicating that perhaps the constant variance assumption for simple linear regressions does not hold."
Context,"After an intense game, Spain ultimately won and left the Netherlands with their third, second place title (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup)."
Struct,"On the next page, Figure 5 shows the average relationship between each predictor and the outcome in our final model (4)"
MethJust,"However, these residauls do not affect the 'fittness' because they are consistent with 4 outliers mentioned in EDA during heat wave in 1995"
Int,"While it's plausible to believe the number of non-accidental deaths would fall in the range of 106 to 112 deaths on a 70-degree day, various external factors out of our control influence mortality as well, such as sociopolitical events or even personal health."
Data,"In the middle category, we have Business and Other."
MethJust,"Specifically, the large sample size makes it so that the t-distribution is indifferent from Normal."
Context,"While the answer to it remained a mystery after numerous research, a more practical question is often asked: How could we extend the life expectancy for humans."
Data,The most common answer is “never” with 961 users and the least common answer is “often” with 20 users.
MethDef,"Therefore, the linear model we are using for the study is the same as the one presented above for the hypothesis testing."
RQDef,We also hypothesize that the News and Politics category will hold the least amount of channels because a good amount of people read the news and don’t exactly watch it.
RQDef,"Essentially, we predict that drug use is associated with relationship status."
Context,"Overall, our analysis can improve the position of YouTube creators to have better engagement and more fame."
Lim,"Lastly, the current dataset only includes animal species with spinal cords."
Struct,The following is a histogram of the data for the variables “month”.
Res,"In general, all six claims show large gaps between the median and mean, which implies that the data points are not evenly distributed and there would be outliers."
Data,Metabolic.by.mass and Lifespan are the two key variables that will answer Jorgensen's question.
Struct,"Especially, I was interested in relationship bewteen temperature and other covariates."
RQDef,The third question of this report considers whether the relative humidity of the forest is associated with the area burned.
Res,"After running our two-sample proportion test, we find that our statistic is -0.1964, and our pValue is 0.8443."
Data,"The lowest value, other than those who do not wish to report, is 20,000, while the highest is 1,000,000."
Int,"The exponential mortality in 1995 is likely a consequence of the 1995 Chicago heatwave, which caused 739 heat-related deaths in Chicago in 5 days (3)"
RQDef,Question 3: Does drug usage have an effect on relationship status.
RQDef,"It stands to reason that less humidity in a forest would lend itself to fires of greater severity, and when humidity is high, it may be more difficult for wildfires to grow out of control."
Data,"In this study, we are given a data with 5,114 observations and 6 variables of measurements of air quality, number of non-accidental deaths, and mean temperature in Chicago, Illinois from Jan 1987 to Dec 2000"
Data,A boxplot for Metabolic.rate (figure not shown) also indicates some outliers (2).
RQDef,"As wetter climates with greater amounts of water in the surrounding environment are shown by previous studies to be less conducive to large fires, we predict that there is a negative, significant linear correlation between RH and area."
Int,This suggets that we may want to explore this potential relationship further in the analysis.
Data,"According to the following figure 3, the distribution of RH in the dataset is bimodal, with the modes occurring at 25-29 and around 40."
RQDef,"Is the effect of air pollution instantaneous, or does it propagates and extends over time."
Res,"The distribution was bimodal and skewed right, signaling that the mean moisture content was higher than the median moisture content."
MethJust,"We can justify the use of a t-test for the distribution of age because of random sampling (assumed to be a random sample of n=1500 from the population), large population (59946>n=1500*30), and the distribution having no outliers (even though the distribution is skewed, the use of a t-test is still valid because of the large sample size and no outliers)."
Data,"To answer our research question, we will be exploring temperature, median ozone concentration, median sulfur dioxide concentration, median density of $PM_{10}$ pollution, and the death rate."
MethDef,All the predictors are fit using spline smoothers with 4 degrees of freedom.
RQDef,"Thus, autumn and spring are also theorized to have forest fire severity in the middle of the other two seasons, as we will assume they represent a middle ground in terms of temperature and rainfall."
Context,"Like how long is a player on the field on average during the World Cup, how often each position is supposed to pass the ball on average in the World Cup, and how much time each position is supposed to play on average in the World Cup."
Lim,There is also not enough data set for younger subscribers that might have resulted in a negative correlation.
RQDef,It is safe to assume that countries with larger populations and countries with more global reach will gain higher views.
MethDef,Drawing a line of best fit can also help us see how strong the relationship is between these two variables.
MethJust,This is also large enough.
Lim,"First, this was not a causal analysis because we used only observational data."
Int,This indicates we cannot say definitively that reducing the metabolic rate for this animal will result in an increase in lifespan (3).
Lim,"Knowing team sizes can greatly affect the number of substitutions that can be made, which affects playing time."
Int,"We conducted a thorough study on the relationship between Lifespan and Metabolic Rate and determined that a lower metabolic rate generally resulted in a longer lifespan, although this negative relationship became nearly nonexistent within a small range of metabolic rates."
Data,The data was collected from ScienceForums.Net and used samples ranging from 2002-2014.
Data,"The relationships are logically very similar to those seen with our original variables in the previous section, but the range of each individual predictor is less varied since each observation is an average."
Lim,"(3) Finally, we note strongly that this analysis was limited to solely the Chordata phylum, and so one would have to do more analysis with other groups of animals in order to generalize our assertion about the negative relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan."
MethJust,"Based on this, we find the lagged model to be the best fit for the data as it has a smaller error."
Data,"From this dataset we define two key variables, lifespan and 'metabolic.by.mass'."
RQDef,"The research had made use of data collected from 1,259 different YouTube channels in order to determine whether or not their viewsPerVideo count were related to factors such as channel category and number of subscribers."
Res,"Upon observation of plot 3 we see that, while the entertainment category holds the account with the largest subscriber count, the comedy category has the highest median subscriber count per account at 2.94 million subscribers."
MethJust,"With this log-transformation, it is a little bit easier to see the relationship between our response and predictor variables."
Data,"Henceforth, references to these variables will refer to their log-transformed values unless otherwise noted (4)."
Struct,"Now that all the models have been created, we will compare them to decide which model is the best performing."
MethDef,"In our case, the saturated model would be the following Poisson generalized linear model: Death ~ $beta_0$ + $PM_{10}$ + $O_3$ + $SO_2$ + 'temperature'"
MethJust,"Second, the population must be at least 20 times as large as the sample."
Lim,"A major limitation of our model is that it uses data from 1987 to 2000, which is not up-to-date (3)"
Struct,"(1) In figure 5, we assess the univariate distribution of our response variable, the logarithmically transformed death rate."
Data,"However, for 'Temperature' variable, it is clear that it is left-skewed, and its median is greater than the mean."
Lim,Perhaps a more directed study toward alcohol and drug use is required to produce a faithful conclusion rather than information from a dating site.
MethJust,"Based on the residuals diagnostics plots of our chosen model, we have some hesitancy with assuming that all of the assumptions are met."
Res,"(1) We have been able to demonstrate that metabolic rate (adjusted for mass) has an inverse relationship with longevity on average across species, and put forward a robust spline model to predict longevity based on metabolic rate and mass."
Lim,"Almost a decade ago, the way individuals use dating services has changed drastically with the introduction of Tinder and Bumble."
Struct,The first plot in this figure visualizes the relationship between the two variables without any transformations.
Data,"The answer “never”, represented by the green, has the highest median, with 32 years."
RQDef,Our formal hypotheses are.
MethJust,"In terms of prediction errors, it seems that the linear regression model gives the best prediction error."
Lim,Concerns also exist regarding the effects of climate change on data — conclusions drawn 17 years ago are likely to be less relevant given the rapid ecological and meteorological changes over the last decade.
Data,"Similarly, the body mass of the species appears to be roughly the same, as can be seen in figure 2."
Data,The sample median for age is 31.00.
Lim,"To address this, the raw data should be organized into groups that would be reflected in the tests whether that is completely omitting the unknown data or creating another variable for it."
Data,"For the continents, the Americas have the most amount of channels at 634, while Asia and Europe come in second and third with 405 and 178 respectively."
Data,The average total passes was 84.521 passes with a standard deviation of 77.310 passes.
Lim,"One major bias is that the data taken is from an OkCupid database, which means it isn’t simple random sampling, which technically invalidates the chi-square test."
Data,"To formulate this hypothesis, we will need to focus on the mean shots attempted for each position."
MethDef,"(1) Since the body mass of an animal would contribute to its metabolic rate, we want to only compare different animals' metabolic rate per gram, which is why we first divided the variable 'Metabolic.rate' by 'Body.mass.g' to obtain a new column 'Metabolic.by.mass'."
RQDef,Question 3: Does the forum in which a thread belongs to affect view count.
RQDef,We hypothesize that the channels labeled with the frequent categories have more subscribers than the channels labeled as the least frequent categories.
Struct,"To visualize drug use in correlation with lower income, we observe the box plots below."
Lim,A heteroskedasticity violation means that our confidence intervals based on our model's standard errors are not reliable.
Data,"Many people drink socially, dedicatedly, or not at all."
Lim,"Preston Jorgensen should ask us to analyze a different data set, speak to an expert, or do research into other methods to expand his longevity."
Res,Lagged so2median appears to fluctuate slightly up and down but seems to overall show no association with death rate.
Data,760 articles fall into both of those categories each.
Res,(3) We were able to conclude that weekly average measurements of our variables have a greater association with expected deaths per day than instantaneous measurements for any given day.
MethDef,"In order to test whether there is a relationship between drug usage habits and age, we have to justify the use of an ANOVA test."
Data,The data used for this project was gathered by Mashable for their articles over two years times.
Data,"Account age is measured in weeks, measured on December 31, 2018 for consistency."
MethDef,"For our modeling, however, we can keep these events since the observations include the temperature, which is the main factor in the spike of deaths."
Int,"However, there must be other confounding variables that affects the viewsPerVideo numbers more than that of simply the subscriber count of the channel."
Res,"We found the confidence interval to be [3.49, 5.02] using this method."
Data,"Our next variable is median density of particulate matter pollution, or 'pmp10median', (mg/m^3) and we see that our values are between -37.3761 mg per cubic meter and 320.7248, with mean and median values of -0.1464 and -3.5391 respectively."
MethDef,"First and foremost, we begin by fitting two Poission generalized additive models to the data."
Int,However our dataset and analysis does allow us to conclude that there is an association between an animal species having a lower metabolic rate by mass and a longer mean lifespan.
Res,(1) The crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate has a metabolic rate of 0.002231.
Data,"The plot suggests that $O_3$ and 'death', and 'temperature' and 'death' are negatively correlated, while $SO_2$ and 'death' are positively correlated."

MethDef,We calculated a 95% pivotal confidence interval for the mean number of non-accidental deaths using 1000 bootstrap iterations.
Data,"According to Figure 1, the distributions of lagged or unlagged pollutants are slightly right skewed, and the distribution of lagged or unlagged temperature are slightly left skewed."
Struct,"In the table below, the cross validation errors and standard errors of the estimates are displayed for Models 1 and 2"
Int,"While this is only an associative statement that does not involve any causal claims, we can conclude that lower metabolic rate leads to a higher maximum lifespan under the assumption that class, typical body mass, and typical body temperature are the only confounding variables in the relationship between metabolic rate and maximum lifespan (1)."
Res,"Entertainment’s minimum is around 12.605 thousand, Q1 is around 321.602 thousand, Q3 is around 2.431 million, and the maximum is around 30.791 million views."
MethDef,"We will first construct two Poisson generalized additive models (GAMs), with the log-link function implemented on our response variable, 'death'"

Context,"It is now possible for people to have a career as a Youtuber, by gaining revenue from ads on Youtube videos."
RQDef,Our first question will be to understand the count of views based on the category of the account.
MethDef,"We used a spline model with 6 degrees of freedom to perform this analysis, which was chosen after testing the fit of a linear model and 5 spline models with differing degrees of freedom (1)."
MethDef,We used the nonparametric method of bootstrapping mentioned previously to build a 95% confidence interval for the lifespan.
Data,"Examining the data at the Class taxonomic level in Figure 1, we see that most of our animals are mammals (Mammalia)."
Data,"As we see in the histogram in Figure 1, the data points are heavily skewed to the right as we see few outliers as well to the right side of the graph."
Data,"After deeper analysis into the data, the 4 outliers are 226 deaths on August 13th, 1995, 411 deaths on August 14th 1995, 287 deaths on August 15th 1995, and 228 deaths on August 16th, 1995"
Int,"With this conclusion, we also see that the best position for a player in order to have the most playtime is Goalkeeper, followed by Defender, then Midfielder, and then Forward."
Res,Running an ANOVA test on these two models gives us a p-value of 3.41e-16
Context,Videos can go randomly viral years after they are posted.
MethJust,"Because our population is large, we can safely assume our measures are independent."
MethDef,"Because we'll be using a Poisson GAM with the log link for modeling purposes later, we will examine the distribution fo the log of the response variable."
MethDef,"In this case, we have two means, so we use the two-sample mean test."
Data,We noticed that there are missing values in our data.
MethJust,"However the differences in the mean squared errors and the standard errors are quite small, suggesting that we can not definitively tell which model is better."
Lim,"There are likely many other factors that would lead to a patient having a more diverse stool sample or a more severe liver disease, such as diet or other lifestyle factors."
MethJust,"The variables are again both categorical, so we use a Chi-Square test to determine whether or not there is a correlation between doing drugs and body type."
MethJust,"However, as we do not consider it a candidate for the final model, we will choose Model 5 (spline with $df = 6$), which gives the second least LOOCV error, as our final model."
Data,"The first is our response variable, which we will call Lifespan."
Data,Subscriber is a quantitative variable measuring the number of followers a specific channel has (calculated on a person-by-person basis).
MethJust,"In justifying linearity, we can thus turn to the formal significance test for regression slope."
Res,"Since the p value is nearly 1, that in turn means for all our reasonable alpha significance levels, we do not reject the null hypothesis."
Res,"The median for August is 145.4, which is 23% higher than the second-largest median in September which is 117.9."
Int,"This is because we used observational data, while causal analysis typically requires controlled experiments."
MethJust,The average MSE and standard errors are almost the same across all the models.
Lim,"Also, our data only contains data in Chicago, which means that our model may lack external validity (that the result cannot be generalized to other regions) (3)"
MethDef,So we decided to keep the covariates without any transformations.
RQDef,"Seeing this, we are interested in learning which pollutants have the strongest association with increased deaths."
Data,"The most common category was Entertainment (with 517 channels, categorizing 41% of the total channels), while the least common category was Sports (with 23 channels, compromising 1.83% of all the channels)."
Lim,Diets of animals may have an impact on their lifespan because scavengers and other animals who have trouble finding consistent food may prematurely die of hunger rather than natural causes.
Struct,We will start by looking at each variable individually.
MethDef,We also derived this confidence interval using a non parametric bootstrap.
Context,"However, it is rarely studied how the effects of air pollution on mortality differ for different kinds of pollutants."
Struct,"(1) Next we will explore our response variable, log of non-accidental deaths."
Lim,"Similarly, the QQ-plot in figure 11 indicates that perhaps the Gaussian assumption of normality does not hold, as there is some deviation of the standardized residuals from the theoretical quantiles near the largest and smallest theoretical quantiles."
MethJust,"As there is a very large difference between the two errors, it is likely that this difference is significant and any uncertainty is negligible, and as such we will be using model 2 for the rest of the analysis."

Data,Both PM10 and SO2 concentration median are heavily right skewed with mean 0.263677 mg/m^3 and 0.6621939 parts by billion.
Res,Our cross validation prediction error was lowest with the poisson GAM with lagged pollutants and temperature compared to our model with daily averages (non-lagged)
Data,"In the side by side boxplots comparing accountAge for each category of channel in the next figure, we can see there is no significant difference in the range between different categories."
RQJust,It seems reasonable to predict that cases like fraud that directly involve money may have higher total damage as a remedy to the financial loss of plaintiff.
MethDef,(2) Now we can perfrom cross-validation to determine which model would fit the best in our dataset.
Struct,Plot 1 indicates the number of subscribers for each account.
RQDef,"Through our three scenarios and hypotheses tests, we explore the relationship between sex and drinking, smoking, and drug habits."

MethDef,"When constructing the GAM, we applied a nonlinear smoothing function with 4 degrees of freedom for speed and simplicity for all the covariates symbolized by a s() function."
Res,"Using the predicted value and the SE, a 95% confidence interval for the mean number of deaths is (106.3425, 114.5066)"
Res,The plot of our linear model (Figure 5) appears to reflect that intuition.
Data,"Its mean is 19349 grams and its median is 323 grams, which suggests that it is heavily influenced by outliers."
RQDef,"In figure 3 shown above, we plot the categories against the subscribers, to see if there is a relationship between the number of subscribers a group has, and what category the specific group is in."
MethDef,"Along with figure 5, we assess our hypothesis with a hypothesis test for the difference in means."
RQDef,We also want to find out if the relationship between lifespan and metabolic rate is linear or nonlinear.
Data,"The body mass (in grams) of our animals has a notable outlier, which is the elephant."
Data,Standard deviation is greatest for people who answered “often”.
Int,The negative coefficient before metabolic by mass is consistent with what we expect.
Int,"In general, the channels specific to any category generally performs similarly based on the box sizes representing the distribution."
MethJust,"From the previous analysis and looking at the residual plot, we think that a large contribution to the low $r^2$ is the inconsistent variance."
MethJust,"However, in the residual plot it seems that the constant variance assumption may be violated."
MethDef,"To allow for more flexibility, we also use splines to construct our model."
MethDef,H0: There is no association between sex and drug habits (sex and drug habits are independent).
MethJust,"The model without transformation has multiple R-squeared of 0.2929, the model with 'Metabolic.by.mass' log transformed has multiple R-squeared of 0.342, the model with both variables log transformed has multiple R-squeared of 0.6036, and the model with 'Metabolic.by.mass' variable square-rooted has multiple R-squeared of 0.2345."
Data,The second key value that we look into is Maximum Longevity in years.
RQDef,"We hypothesized that as we age, we suffer more health issues that can lead to more hospital stays."
Int,"When answering question 3, we did see a strong relationship between the countries that videos are uploaded from and the views those videos gather on average."
Res,"Running an ANOVA test on these two models, with the new model being the ""reduced"" model, shows that the reduced model with temperature as the only feature has a deviance that's 94.369 higher than our full model with both pollutants and temperature as features"
RQDef,The second scenario would examine whether there is a relationship between Total Damages and Damages Demanded.
Data,"We will also examine diversity, severity, and diagnosis."
MethJust,"Since this is greater than 30, it is a large enough sample size."
Other,"If the points on the QQ plot form a straight/linear line, this is an indication that our model is strong regarding normality."
Res,"In doing this, we saw that during the warmer months, specifically August with a median DMC of 145.4, the moisture content was higher than the winter months, because we looked at the median of each respective box plot."
MethJust,"While there are still outliers, that is to be expected given our error value."
MethJust,"However, as we measure severity, not frequency, we need to analyze the area variable, as what matters is not the number of fires but how many hectares are burnt."
MethJust,"(2) By comparing the pairs plots of log-transformed key variables (Figure 2 above) and original key variables (figure not shown), we can discern that log-transformation provides much better linear relationship between 'log.maximum.longevity.yrs' and 'log.metabolic.by.mass', as well as between 'Temperature' and 'log.metabolic.by.mass' than the original variables."
Data,"(4) We can see in figure 10 that the logarithmic number of deaths across the years has a relatively cyclic distribution, with perhaps lower death rates in certain seasons than others."
Res,"We start with a boxplot (Figure 1), we observe that the most viewed videos on average are the music videos."
MethJust,"Since these variables are not perfectly normally distributed with the log transformations and their relationship is only approximately linear, this suggests that a non-parametric model might best capture the relationship in the data rather than a linear model."
MethDef,"Note that these models were fitted to the same data using the same smoothing parameter selection method (i.e., smoothing spline with 4 degrees of freedom)"
Data,"Except for these two cases, morality follows a similar trend every year."
Context,"In addition, the one with more subscribers also has more views in each video he uploaded."
Struct,We define some key variables for our research.
Res,"However, this inverse relationship is not constant throughout all values of metabolic rates."
Res,"Based on the plot of our spline model (Figure 4), we can see that animals with lower metabolic rates generally do have longer lifespans (1)."
Data,"To help answer these questions, we are using a subset of the AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity."
MethJust,This suggests that differences between the models are not significant and depending on the random folds selected in our cross-validation other models may have the lowest prediction error.
Context,"Overall, our analysis can help content creators and viewers alike understand what variables can contribute to videos gaining more views."
Int,"The lower the metabolic rate, the higher the lifespan."
Data,"In general, the distributions of all key variables are skewed and suffer from outliers (2)."
Int,"However, there is no guarantee that reducing the metabolic rate of a crab-eating raccoon by 50% will cause its lifespan to increase by 43.2% (2)."
Res,"On the other hand, lagged temperature showed the most flat curve which implies that the temperature is less associated with the death rate."
Data,"Base on the data set I found from ISEL (https://isle.stat.cmu.edu/36-200-A,B,C,D,E,G spring21/youtube_project1/), which contains information up to the end of 2018, provides analytics and tracks per-channel information like the number of subscribers and the number of views."
Data,"To restate, our time variable gives the date of each observation for our predictors and response."
Lim,"Thus, it would be possible that I get different best models when I change the cross validation procedure."
Int,"By comparing the performance of these two models, we were able to discover that the effects of pollutants on mortality seem to extend over time rather than being instaneous."
RQDef,"Given the life history of approximately 350 animals, we will study the effect of metabolic rate on overall lifespan to determine the relationship between the two (if one exists)."
Data,"This means that the distribution of metabolic rate per unit body mass should also be roughly the same for most species, which can be seen in figure 3 with the right-skewed distribution with small intervals between each bar."
MethDef,"Therefore, we will use cross-validation (CV) to perform model selection."
RQDef,Our first research question is whether diversity of the microbiome of a stool sample is related to whether the sample has MDRB or not.
Data,"As shown in Figure 2, the distruibution is unimodal and heavily skewed to the right."
MethDef,"In this case, we put together two Poisson generalized additive models."
RQDef,The last question in our report is to investigate whether total burnt area is associated with outside relative humidity.
MethDef,We then utilized a 5-fold cross-validation procedure in order to see which model would have the lowest cross-validation average mean-squared errors and if the standard errors seemed reasonable.
Struct,Figure 5 depicts the histogram and boxplot for our response variable.
Lim,"Therefore, this indicates that one or more of our model assumptions may be violated and based on our analysis of residual diagnostics in the modeling and diagnostics section we can infer that the residuals do not have a constant spread."
Res,The linear fit seems mostly horizontal which does not indicate a clear positive or negative relationship.
Int,"This means that the mean playtime for each position is not equal, and we can conclude that there is sufficient evidence for a relationship between position and playtime."
Data,We will focus on 5 key variables in the $Anage$ dataset.
Res,"In addition, the correlation coefficient for total damages vs demanded is only 0.275."
Struct,Figure 3 is a scatter plot of viewsPerVideos vs subscribers.
MethJust,"In order to best do this, we are going to use a box plot so that we can compare the breakdowns side by side."
Context,"Dating apps are the new craze, with a multitude of different versions seemingly appearing from thin air in the past few airs."
Lim,This work can be further built on using new data using newer analysis models or using the same models by building hypotheses in the given data.
RQDef,It examines the month of forest fire occurrence and investigates potential relationship between area and two other factors of initial spread index and outside relative humidity.
Res,We again try to compare the proportions of variables we want to examine: the proportion of overweight individuals who have never done drugs to total overweight people is higher than both the proportion of fit people who have never done drugs to total individual fit people and the proportion of athletic people who have never done drugs to total individual athletic people.
Struct,"Blow is a scatterplot, having “viewsPerVideo” on the x-axis and “subscribers” on the y-axis."
RQDef,"When analyzing a player, the number of shots one attempts can be reasonably suspected to be linked to how good of a player they are."
Int,The relationship does not exhibit a very clear linearity but can be recognized as reasonably linear.
Struct,"Below in Figure 2, we see two scatterplots created with using explanatory and response variable (5)."
Context,"After this analysis, we hope that Preston Jorgensen can understand the the factors influencing average lifespan better."
Res,"We found that (1) there is adequate evidence that pollutants are associated with increased mortality, among which $O_3$ has the strongest association."
Res,"We are given a confidence interval of [0.038, 0.1102], with -0.074 not fitting into the interval, it is not likely the true value."
Struct,"Furthermore, we can investigate some summary statistics about maximum longevity to understand its distribution better."
MethDef,"After fitting our simple linear regression model, we moved on to explore using smoothing splines to leverage the power and flexibility that these more complex models afford us."
MethJust,"Since our outcome variable is based on counts, we decided to use a poisson regression in our generalized additive model (GAM) which are commonly used with count reponses."
Data,"The smallest, or youngest mean, is for the often category, with a mean of 26.900."
MethJust,"In other words, the model where mortality is related to pollutants and temperature over time appears to fit the data better than the model where mortality is related to pollutants and temperature over a single day."
RQJust,"However, it could also depend on the career a person is in."
Data,The primary focus will be on the shots attempted.
Data,"From this data, we see that the majority of this sample of OkCupid users don’t smoke."
RQJust,This suggests a possible association between these two variables.
Res,We therefore fail to reject the null hypothesis.
Data,"Each article was then measured in terms of the number of shares received (count), and the number of words in the title."
MethDef,"We created an estimate for the the mean number of deaths on a 70-degree day with the smallest value observed for each pollution variable: 'o3median' = -23.2 (ppb), 'so2median' = -7.3 (ppb), 'pm10median' = -37.4 (mg per cbm)"
Data,"Our research questions will also focus on the three variables of playtime, shots attempted, and total passes."
MethJust,"Since this is greater than 30, it is a large enough sample size."
Data,"We noticed that the distribution of $Max.lifespan$ is heavily right-skewed, with a mean of 16.01 years and a median of 12.9 years (3)."
Data,"The distribution is also slightly skewed to the right, with a couple irregular jumps in the number of players with high playing times at 250 to 299 minutes and 350 to 399 minutes."
Data,"As a result, the variables that we use in the models are log(Lifespan) and log(Metabolic.by.mass)."
Lim,Further research is required into reasonings behind social media sharing to understand the differences observed between the shares throughout channels observed in this report.
RQDef,"Many people refuse to date people involved with drug use out of the assumption that they are not fit physically or emotionally (as stated by https://www.distractify.com/p/fitness-dating-app), so in this paper we will pursue the idea of a correlation between drug use and overall well-being."
MethJust,"Based on all five residual plots, the residuals appear to have a random spread approximately centered about zero."
RQJust,"Since there is different access to technology, the number of subscribers to channels can differ from one continent to another."
MethDef,The 2 Poisson generalized additive models for our data will have one with unlagged versions of air pollutant variables and another with lagged versions of air pollutant variables.
RQDef,We want to assess how well our model fits the data.
Data,"We will restrict our exploration to the Phylum Chordata of the Kingdom Animalia, and further restrict our exploration to species with complete data in the AnAge dataset."
Context,"When it came out in “2005, YouTube is now one of the most popular sites on the Web, with visitors watching around 6 billion hours of video every month”(as reported by https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/youtube/what-is-youtube/1/)."
Data,"In contrast, the lowest mean is recorded in “News & Politics” as 2,008,807 subscribers with a standard deviation of 1,477,641."
MethDef,"For simplicity, I used 4 degrees of freedom for all spline terms."
Data,"(1) There are several variables in the dataset including longevity, meatabolic rate, body mass."
Data,"However, the lagged versions appear to have smaller variance, and their distributions are less skewed than the original variable (1)"
Int,Our hypothesis is refuted by the evidence.
Struct,(2) We will start by looking at each variable individually.
Data,"Given data set from The AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity which contains 347 observations of 14 variables from AnAge for animals in the Chordata phylum including animals with spinal cords, we will answer the following three questions."
Int,"Lastly, we saw that the exact category you post on is not the major contributor of earning a mass following: it seems that what causes a greater subscriber count is keeping up with the trends that are going on in the world, specifically in the more well-known areas and creating content that a large mass of people are swarming to learn about."
Context,"Usually, people with heart conditions are considered high-risk and tend to have a higher premium cost, as hospital visits for heart disease are very costly."
RQDef,We would like to better understand the relationship between medical history and the total cost of claims and what increases the cost of claims.
MethDef,Our null and alternate hypotheses are as follows.
MethJust,"Since the difference in standard error between both models is not significant, we decide to use prediction error alone to conclude that the lagged GAM appears to be the best fit for the data and will be most ideal to use for our results."
MethJust,"4 As the homoscedasticity is only slightly violated and the Gaussian error assumption holds for Model 5, we could also use parametric bootstrap to calculate the confidence interval."
Int,It makes sense as the Goalkeeper would not have much of an opportunity to attempt a shot as the rest of the positions.
Data,"For each species in the data table, we have the following variables: HAGRID (the Human Ageing Genomic Resources ID), Kingdom (along with phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species), common name, maximum longevity (lifespan) in years, typical adult body mass in grams, typical resting metabolic rate in Watts, and typical body temperature in Kelvin."
Data,"Our research questions for this report(included in the next section), will also contain the variables of position and total passes."
MethDef,"Since we used a Poisson regression additive model, we need to test whether 'death' follows the Poisson distribution."
Res,From the table above we are able to see that there is a decent amount of variation of total passes across the different positions.
RQDef,"Lastly, we want to determine the mean death rate for Chicago on a 70-degree day if we had the lowest value pollutants ever recorded to determine if lowering pollution is worth Preston Jorgenson's investment (1)"
RQDef,"Lastly, Jorgensen was interested in the average death rate for a 70 degree day (farenheit) if pollutants were reduced to the lowest levels ever recorded."
Lim,"Also for future research, the data set needs to have a larger sample size as health issues are too complex and with a larger sample size, there will be less random error."
Struct,"To understand the data further, we use a matrix plot to look at the relationship between variables(3) as displayed in the figure below."
Context,"Preston Jorgensen, a billionaire who is interested in knowing what factors appear to be related to lifespan."
Res,The median number of views for Great Britain is around 1.354 million.
MethDef,"Because we want to proceed with Poisson GAMs with logarithmic link, we must transform our response variable of death into a logarithmic sclae."
MethDef,Our null and alternative hypotheses are.
MethDef,We use the pivotal confidence interval and 1000 bootstrap iterations.
MethDef,"Therefore, we looked at the level of uncertainty of each plot as well to determine which relationship between pollutant and mortality is strongest and with the least uncertainty."
MethDef,"We also constructed a 95% confidence interval for this mean lifespan, using the pivotal confidence interval and 1000 bootstrap iterations (bootstrap by resampling cases)."
Res,"We note that for 'Metabolic.by.mass.log' going from -10 to -7, the spline predicts the 'Maximum.longevity.yrs.log' to slightly decrease, albeit very slowly, and then once the 'Metabolic.by.mass.log' reaches -7, the spline linearly decreases after that."
Data,"The mean number of views was 1346843185 views, and the standard deviation was 2036809998 views."
Data,"The last variable included in the research questions is RH, which is a measurement of the humidity when the forest fire occurred and is measured in percentage (%)."
MethJust,"(5) As the residuals are centered around mean 0, but they appear to not have a constant spread, indicating that perhaps they do not depend on the metabolic rate per unit body mass, we should use a method of nonparametric bootstrapping and resample the residuals to assess uncertainty so as to prevent accidental convergence on the wrong model."
Int,This however doesnt guarantee that lowering the metabolic rate of an animal species will directly correlate to that species have higher lifespan due to the variety of other factors that play a role in an animal species lifespan that isnt taken into consideration in our dataset.
Lim,It’s hard to make concrete conclusions about the World Cup in general with analysis of data only from the 2010 World Cup.
Lim,"To address this issue, we may consider applying better transformations to our variables so that homoscedasticity would hold (4)."
RQDef,"Next, we will use different methods to predict the number of deaths on a 70-degree day with the minimum observed value for each polution variable."
Context,One way upcoming entrepreneurs are starting to make a living online is through the well-known app Youtube.
Res,"With one unit of increase in metabolic rate, there is decrease in lifespan of 1.669777 years."
MethJust,Thus this solidifies the idea that we should use transformations.
Data,"The variable position is a categorical variable that represents the position (role) of the player: there are 4 broad categories that players were put into (Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder, Forward)."
RQDef,Our goal therefore from this report is to better understand the behavior and impact of the number of subscribers.
Lim,"One flaw in the data is that some variables vary over samples, but others vary by patient."
Struct,The research question we have on the following pages uses 2 more variables.
Struct,We can better see these possible differences in a chart as included below.
MethDef,"(1) Since we may have some doubt whether 'Temperature' is a confounding variable or not, we fit a linear regression to control as below: [ text{log(Maximum.longevity.yrs)} = beta_0 + beta_1text{log(Metabolic.by.mass)} + beta_2text{Temperature} ]."
MethDef,We could try resampling the residuals to see if this is a sampling issue.
Data,"Our investigation focused on Categories for a sample of 1259 Youtube Channels, gathered by Social Blade and containing data up to the end of 2018, and explored potential relationships with Countries and Subscriber Count."
RQDef,We could suggest that physically well people stray away from drug use more than those deviating from physical wellness.
Int,"Although our prediction results gave a mean number of deaths that is lower than average, we cannot conclude that the action of reducing pollutants would cause a decrease in mortality because the dataset consisted of observational data."
Int,We only used observational data here.
Int,"This means that the mean total passes for each position is not equal, and we can conclude that there is sufficient evidence for a relationship between position and total passes."
Lim,"More precisely, it seems as if all the points that have 'Metabolic.by.mass.log <= 7' follow less of a negative linear relationship than the points that have 'Metabolic.by.mass.log >= 7'."
Lim,Another limitation is the when the study was performed: 2012.
Int,This is strong evidence that there is a relationship between metabolism and longevity.
Int,The answer was no.
RQDef,"Because we have reason to believe the majority of users are over age 30, we will test the following hypothesis."
Res,"As shown by the set of histograms above, the category Entertainment has the greatest overall range of values, with a maximum of 27.765M and a minimum of 107.968K."
Lim,"As stated in 5.1, to better understand the association between $SO_2$ and 'death', we need to have a narrower confidence band that gives more certainty."
Res,"(4) These conclusions are consistent with a Wald test of significance for each smooth term in our GAM where we found p-values of 1.08e-07, 3.36e-06, and < 2e-16 for lagged PM10, ozone, and temperature respectively which suggests that we should reject the null hypothesis that these variables do not contribute to the model's fit at a significance level of 1%"
Res,"A 95% CI for our prediction is [103.2623, 111.3955] people (5)"
RQDef,"If so, which air pollutant is most strongly associated with mortality."
Data,"The key variables we will use to answer the research questions are death, pm10median, lag_pm10median, o3median, lag_o3median, so2median, lag_so2median, tmpd, and lag_tmpd."
Context,"However, in recent years, public outcry arose with regard to the size of the damage paid to the plaintiff."
Data,(1) The crab-eating raccoon has an initial lifespan of 19 years and an initial metabolic rate of 2.588 Watts with an initial body mass of 1160 grams.
Res,"We also found that the lagged affect of pollution is quite clear and benefits our resultant model significantly when compared to a model that does not use pollution measurements as variables, and we can generally say that there is a positive association with increased measurements of pollution and deaths."
MethJust,"(4) Similarly, in figures 6 and 7 we can see that there is an extremely skewed distribution between both metabolic rate and lifespan as well as body mass and lifespan, with almost seemingly no relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan or body mass and lifespan."
MethJust,We kept it in for the analysis above because the NA values do not affect the histograms and we thought it would be helpful to see that there is a portion of the data that we are not utilizing because of lack of measurements and data.
Lim,"If we were to continue with this study, we’d work towards simple random sampling as well as eliminating null values."
Data,"When examining the scatterplot, the right-skewedness of TotalPasses is evident."
RQDef,"(3) Finally, we would estimate the mean death rate in Chicago on a 70-degree day when each pollutant is lowered to its lowest recorded value."
Res,"Also, the standard error of the effect seems to be the smallest for the plot of $lag_ozone$"
Struct,"To further examine, I looked into the trend of pollutants over the given time interval."
Data,The sample we will be using has a sample size of 1500 and 17 variable categories.
Struct,Figure 1 shows the histogram of the response and explanatory variables.
Res,"Our 95% confidence interval for the mean number of deaths is [113.7422, 116.2422], and our estimate will be 114.9840 (5)"
Int,"A final explanation is that there are lurking variables unaccounted for in this research analysis that lend autumn to be high-risk for fires — as an example, perhaps the trees in the forest are deciduous, and the dried dead leaves create the perfect circumstances for large wildfires."
MethDef,"This variable was calculated by dividing the typical resting metabolic rate by the typical adult body mass, which were both values provided in the AnAge database (1)."
MethDef,"However, we will be creating a new variable called 'Metabolic.by.mass', which is the the amount of energy used per unit of body mass, instead of using 'Metabolic.rate' since 'Metabolic.by.mass' allows to compare the animals of different sizes."
MethJust,"The graph showing a log function applied to both variables shows the clearest linearity with minimal bending, so going forward we will work with both variables with a log function attached."
MethJust,"Because we have random sample, a sufficiently large population, and a sufficiently large sample size (n=1500>40), the smallest and largest sample standard deviations (7.159 and 10.410) are within a factor of two, and we are comparing means from independent populations, we can justify the use of an ANOVA test."
Int,"From our analysis, we cannot conclude whether the effect of air pollution is instantaneous or it propagates over time (1)"
Int,This can be due to seasonal weather changes that influence both temperature and air pollution levels.
Data,The dataset contains 347 observations of animals in the Chordata phylum (animals with spinal cords).
RQDef,"Next, we want to formally test whether the pollutants alone are associated with mortality."
MethJust,"However, we decide to use the second model for the rest of the analyses because of the slightly smaller average prediction error."
Data,"Lastly, 'tmpd' looks to be almost bimodal at 35 degrees and 70 degrees Farenheight."
Data,"The distribution of $pm10$ appears to be right-skewed, with a mean of -0.2637 and a median of -3.5122 (1)"
RQDef,"Our goal is to try to understand and unpack how the algorithm works what trends we see in videos, their views, and the accounts they are posted on."
Context,The goal of this research is to inform Preston Jorgenson which pollutants are most strongly associated with mortality so he can make a decision to help extend his life (1)
Int,"According to our analysis, the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan is not-linear."
Data,Duration of stay is also a quantitative variable measuring the number of days of duration of treatment condition.
Res,"The value produced by the test is 0, which indicates that for these data, there is significant evidence to reject the original model in favor of a ""saturated model"" with n degrees of freedom (meaning our model fit could be better)"
Res,"We gathered that comedy is the most popular video category, and that the majority of YouTube’s user base is located in the United States."
MethDef,"Using the data, we develop a model for the number of non-accidental deaths from the pollutants in the air and temperature, allowing us to understand its implications."
RQJust,This suggests a possible association between these two variables.
Struct,We will attempt to verify this possible trend in our modeling done below.
RQDef,This then means that the Entertainment category will have the most number of views because it was the most frequent category.
MethDef,"(3) and some of (4) Due to the right skewness of both histogram distributions pre-transformation, we perform a square root transformation on metabolic rate, the explanatory variable, and a log transformation on lifespan, the response variable to rectify the skews."
Res,"When we plug these values into the linear model and the spline model, we get 17.60354 and 20.77764."
Context,Dating apps such as OkCupid has helped people find friends and soulmates all over the world.
RQDef,It can be assumed that the distribution of the number of shots differs depending on the position a player is in as each position is required to perform different actions.
Other,The right skewed box plot suggests a higher mean than the median).
Res,We found that there is an association with all 3 types of pollutants with ozone having the strongest correlation (1)
Struct,"Next, we explored how the variables were related to each other in order to get a better idea of how to fit models to the data."
Res,"First, we saw that the distribution of moisture content (including humidity) was far from perfect."
Int,"(3) From our analyses, we found that (1) there is evidence that these pollutants are associated with increased mortality and ozone concentration is the most strongly associated with mortality, (2) we cannot determine if the effect of pollution is instantaneous or extends over time, and (3) the estimated mean deaths for Chicago on a 70-degree day when the pollutant levels are the lowest values ever recorded is about 110 deaths so we don't recommend Jorgensen spend his fortune to try to reduce pollution to those levels because this predicted number of deaths is not much different from the average number of deaths on any given day."
Struct,We thus test the following hypothesis.
MethJust,It is important to note that the difference between all 6 of these models did not appear to be significant.
Data,Our response variable is 'death' and all the rest variables are covariates.
Context,And it’s because of this exact reason why we need to analyze the forest fires weather index - so we can make better environmental decisions that will positively impact the world we live in.
Res,Performing the test we get a statistic value of 1.1088 and a pValue of 1.1088.
Int,"Thus, although we could conclude that Model 2 fits better than the null model, there is significant evidence to reject Model 2 in favor of a saturated model (1)"
Struct,"Now, we can conduct multivariate analysis on our dataset."
MethDef,"This metabolic.rate corresponds to a metabolic.by.mass value of .002231034, which we multiply by 1/2 to estimate the Crab-eating raccoons new mean lifespan."
Lim,"We note our concerns for not satisfying this requirement, but will move on and address it in the discussions section of the report."
Int,"A possible explanation would be how people may repeatedly watch, for example, music videos and educational videos for learning."
Int,"Overall, we found that if an upcoming entrepreneur wants to enter the youtube space, they should know that youtube overall mainly consists of entertainment, music, and gaming."
MethDef,We can take the logarithm of the death variable because we are sure that all values are greater than 0 because the minimum is 69
Res,"As it can be seen in table one, on average videos in the Music and Education category receive more viewsPerVideo and Gaming and News & Politics have the least viewsPerVideo on average."
RQJust,Those who are single have the greatest range in height while those who are married have the smallest.
Data,"Looking solely at our predictors, we see that some of them may be associated with each other."
Int,(2) Preston Jorgensen should not spend his enormous fortune to reduce the pollutants to their minimum recorded values because our analyses do not demonstrate a causal relationship whereby reducing pollutants causes a decrease in mortality by the amount our model estimated.
Res,"The mode of the data is in the first bar which contains the range of 4500-5.2871M where 1,094 videos out of 1,259 channels (86.89% of the total channels)."
Data,"'so2median' is also skewed right and unimodal at 0, but with a smaller range of values."
Data,"Specifically, the variables included in this dataset are the day of the obervation, the number of non-accidental deaths each day, the mean temperature (farenheit), the median concentration of ozone (parts per billion), median concentration of sulfur dioxide (parts per billion), and the median concentration of particulate matter with a diameter less than 10 micrometers (PM10, $mg/m^3$)"
MethDef,"Now we conduct a 1000 sample non parametric bootstrapping, to check the significance of our results described in the paragraph above."
Res,"After creating the generalized additive model, we analyzed the model by obtaining a confidence interval of the mean number of deaths on a 70-degree day with the lowest pollutant values and found that reducing pollutant values to the lowest level seems to be associated with little to no change in death rate."
Data,"$lag_pm10$ follows similar distribution as $pm10$ but is less right-skewed, and its median is -1.71240 (1)"
Struct,"These numbers can be found in table 1, below."
MethJust,"(2) As can be seen in table 1, the estimated predicted mean squared error (MSE) of the linear model is the lowest at 0.103, whereas the estimated predicted MSE's of the splines corresponding to 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 degrees of freedom are 1.287, 1.282, 1.294, 0.114, 0.109 respectively."
Int,"The influence of these pollutants on mortality appears to extend over time, rather than act instantaneously."
Res,"From this test we obtained a p value of 0.86, which is well above 0.05, telling us that this model is a good fit for the data."
MethJust,"From the QQ plot, it seems that the Gaussian noise assumption holds."
MethJust,"A normality plot provides further evidence that these residuals are approximately normal, although there is some deviation at the extremes."
Context,"Using this information, content creators can get a better grasp of what kind of content they want to create (if their goal is to gain the most views) or what number of views to expect based on their content, subscriber count, and country of origin."
RQDef,Our first research question will be looking at how a Youtube accounts category effects its viewsPerVideo and describing the relationship found.
Data,"(3) The distribution of response maximum longevity is right-skewed, and mostly unimodal, with a minor mode to the right of the central mode."
MethDef,"Thus, our final models use Poisson generalized additive models(GAM) with four degrees of freedom and four explanatory variables (pm10median, o3median, so2median, and tmpd)"
Int,"Thus, Jorgensen should not spend his fortune to reduce pollution because reducing pollution might not neccessarily cause decreased death."
MethJust,"Based on observations, there should be transformations on the variables since there were right-skewed."
Data,Views is a quantitative variable that measures the total views across all the videos a channel has.
MethDef,"To formally test the question of whether mean total passes differs by position, we will use ANOVA (analysis of variance)."
Data,"### A Note on Outliers in our Response Variable: Referencing figure 5, it is very clear that four observations fall far outside these bounds in the summer of 1995, with log-death values above 5.4"
Context,The information in this study may be of use to aspiring soccer players as well as professional players that may not be earning as much as they would like to.
RQDef,"Now, we want to calculate the smallest value observed for each pollution varialbe, in order to create an estimate, using our model, for the mean number of deaths on a 70-degree day, witht hose levels of pollutants."
Res,"We found that their relationship is inverse, such that slower metabolic rates yield longer lifespans."
Data,"We see the same distribution shape on the log scale, but with a shorter right tail due to the log-scaling of the outliers."
Data,"To formalize this hypothesis, we will focus on the average title length of each article in all the possible channels."
RQJust,This suggests that there may be a relationship between diversity and SampleMDRB.
Int,"The values in this interval are unable to be rejected as plausible values for the slope given the assumptions and limitations of the model, which we assume only fails less than 5% of the time."
Context,The desire for connection to others is one of the most driving forces of humanity.
Res,"In addition, ‘motor vehicle’, ‘premises liability’, and ‘other’ all illustrate a great number of outliers in the data set."
Res,"Further it can be seen that in Bangladesh and Pakistan the median viewsPerVideo is far lower than other countries, as it lies in the 350,000 to 430,000 viewsPerVideo range."
RQDef,"Second, we analyzed the breakdown of DMC by month."
MethDef,The second model will use the corresponding lagged covariates to determine the possibility of non-accidental deaths being related to air quality and temperature over multiple days.
Struct,"(1) After univartiate analysis of the key variables, we then assessed the data for any underlying relationships between our predictor variables and the response variable of logarithmic death rate."
MethDef,"To evaluate whether the spline model with 3 effective degrees of freedom is valid, we will plot the spline over the data, as well as output residual diagnostics."
RQJust,"Since YouTube contains a variety of content and people are making use of the platform for many different purposes, we can expect videos in different channel categories to bring different audience sizes."
Res,The result is 106.1945 with a 95% confidence interval between 100.2390 and 112.5037 (given by 'predict()' working on the link scale)
Data,The mean of total damages is about 213101.43 dollars with a standard deviation of 7795.00.
Int,"Because this p-value is smaller than the significance level of alpha=0.05, we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, that there is no relationship between the variable drugs and age, and have evidence for the alternative hypothesis, that there is a relationship between drugs and age."
RQDef,Why do some animals live more than others?
Data,The 1500 profiles were based on volunteered sampling.
Struct,Now we will look at the spline graphs for the second model.
Int,This may be due to players that continued further on into the tournament and got to play more games.
Res,"We are given a confidence interval of [-0.0587, 0.048], with 0.005 fitting into the interval, making it a reasonable supposition."
RQDef,"If so, which of them is most strongly associated with mortality."
MethJust,"From figure 3, we see that the relationship between the $Age.log$ and the $Metabolic.log$ are linear now (4)."
Struct,"In Figure 6, the relationships between each covariate and the outcome is displayed."
Res,"Our 95% confidence interval for the mean number of deaths is [105.3051, 110.6711]"
RQDef,The third scenario would investigate whether the amount of total damages is related to the claim type.
MethDef,"We suspect a Poisson General Additive Model would be appropriate to investigate the relationship between pollution and deaths in Chicago, wherein our response is assumed to have a Poisson distribution modeled with a log-link function."
RQDef,It seems reasonable to hypothesize that higher demanded damages are associated with higher total damages paid.
Lim,"We note our concerns for not satisfying this, but will continue with our study and will revisit it in the discussions section of the report."
Int,"The slope of 0.43 for the PlayTime indicates that for each additional minute of playing time, we estimate an additional half of a pass made for the player."
MethDef,"Again, our hypotheses are."
RQJust,"We can see that people who are single, seeing someone, or available are mostly younger adults around with a median age of 30 years old while those who are married have a median age of 40 years old."
Data,"The AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity is a ""a curated database of ageing and life history in animals""."
Struct,We begin by investigating the univariate distributions for our predictor variables.
Data,This is why we see that the mean in these plots is slightly lower than the median.
Struct,The distribution of the log of response variable is shown by the Figure 2
Int,"Overall, we have evidence that the true mean of the user profiles’ age was greater than 30 year and that there is a relationship between drugs and age, but not that there was a relationship between age and income."
RQDef,"For this study, we used a generalized additive model on the lagged covariates to determine the association between atmospheric pollutants and death rate."
Res,We find that there is a negative and nonlinear relationship between lifespan and metabolic rate.
MethDef,We concluded that a log transformation on both of the variables provides the most linear relationship as the points on this scatterplot most closely follow the linear smoother (4).
MethJust,The reason why we used these complex models rather than a linear model is due to the increased flexibility we get from not assuming the relationships between our predictors and the response ('death') are linear.
RQJust,"When a plaintiff is successful in court, the judge would rule in the plaintiff’s favor."
RQJust,"Because the deviance is -236.59, which is high, it seems like there is a large difference in the two models (2)"
Data,The last variable is tmpd which is the mean temperature in Fahrenheit.
MethJust,This raises the idea that perhaps a transformation should be used on this variable.
Data,The histogram visualizes the shape of the distribution as also being skewed right without a normal distribution while the boxplot displays there are over 10 outliers with relatively high metabolic rates.
Int,"However, after log-log transformation, we have no evidence to conclude that the relationship between $Age.log$ and $Metabolic.log$ is not linear (1)."
Data,"The pollution and temperature variables also have versions that are 7-day averages of the original variables that start with 'lag_', which will help to validate whether pollution effect is instantaneous or extended over time."
Int,"The results of our research indicate that out of all pollutants, ozone and mortality have the strongest association, followed by particulate matter."
Int,We finally concluded that there would be a similar view count across varying forums within SFN.
MethJust,"We can see that the cross validation error of Model 2, is lower than that of Model 1"
Struct,"While the plots on the upper part off the diagonal show the correlation coefficients between variables, the ones below the diagonal are scatterplots between variables."
Res,"The resulting p-value from the test is less than $2.2times 10^{-16}$, so we reject $H_0$ (2)"
Data,"The histogram of the date variable indicates that we have a somewhat uniform distribution of observations from the start of 1987 to the end of 2000, however there are slightly less observations in the beginning of this timeframe."
MethDef,"Because we have altered our hypothesis after analyzing the scatterplot, we now postulate that income tends to decrease as age decreases, we will use a one sided regression test for slope with an alternative of less than as follows."
MethDef,"Specifically, we tested out degrees of freedom from 3 to 7, inclusive on the spline models."
Lim,"The data analysis could have been improved by going more into depth within each continent or even country- for example, observing the user base of individual states within the United States."
Int,"Therefore, the relationship of pollution and mortality extends over time rather than being instantaneous."
Lim,"Although we showed that our chosen model with certain degrees of freedom does not seem to violate any assumptions that would make the result certain, we may not completely trust the model we have since we only use one variable, Metabolic Rate by Mass, to find out its effect to lifespan."
Data,"A boxplot was made for Lifespan (figure not shown), which did indicate some outliers."
MethJust,"Because we are looking at a categorical explanatory (male/female) and categorical response variable (not at all, often, socially), we use a contingency table."
Data,"In the distribution, we observe that the age 30 seems to split the sample distribution in half (which is why we choose it as our hypothesis value), with a large concentration of users between 18 and 30, while a significant portion of the users make up the tale between 30 and 65."
Data,We can confidently state that the original variables and their respective lag-variables are heavily correlated with each other.
Data,"This database contains compiled information from many species, specifically regarding the species lifespan, age of sexual maturity, adult body mass, typical body temperature, and metabolic rate."
Int,This large difference in deviance of 395.7 serves as further proof that our lagged GAM appears to fit the data better and shows that the effect of pollution appears to extend over time.
MethDef,"In this study, we used a smooth spline model with 6 degrees of freedom to examine the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan."
Data,(2) We plan to use the Age Database of Animal Aging and Longevity.
RQDef,This report observed profile information like physical fitness and income among OkCupid users and how it relates to drug use.
RQDef,"Furthermore, we were also interested in deriving a 95% confidence interval for the specific quantity we estimated above -- the mean lifespan of the raccoon with 50% reduced metabolic rate."
RQJust,This valuable insight suggests that using the 7 day averages of the pollutant concentrations and temperature may better fit the response (log deaths) relative to the daily measured predictors since our response also exhibits seasonal oscillation across time.
MethJust,"Since the linear model of both metabolic rate and body mass has is least squared error loss, this is the best model."
Struct,"Having constructed the model, we can now answer our research question."
Int,It means that effects of pollutants extend over time.
MethDef,"Again, to further dissect this correlation and look for the trend, we generate a contingency table."
Data,"To formalize this hypothesis, we will be focusing on the average title length and day released."
MethDef,We can use the predict function to determine a point estimate of the predicted number of deaths and use the standard error to calculate the 95% confidence interval (5)
Int,This is because the residuals of our model do not follow a normal distribution as we assumed in computing the CI from 'predict()'
Data,"$Anage$ contains data on lifespan, typical body temperature, typical body mass, and typical metabolic rate for over 4200 species (2)."
Data,"Out of the total 1836 trials, the most common type is ‘Other’ (917 cases)."
Lim,"In addition to random sampling, the chi-squared test required an expected cell count of at least 5, and our data did not satisfy this requirement."
Data,"We can also identify that there are fewer data points on the right end of transformed response variable, which could affect our analysis result and confidence interval when we continue."
MethJust,"After conducting an ANOVA test on our simple and these more complex models, we chose to favor our simpler model as both tests yielded p-values greater than 0.05 (log-transformed temperature: p = 0.3361, non-transformed temperature: p-value = 0.2252)."
Int,"Therefore, our model and data indicate that animals with lower metabolic rates have longer lifespans (1)."
Data,"The sample mean for income is $102,340.00, and the sample standard deviation is approximately $195,774.73."
Res,Comparison with parametric bootstrapping 95% confidence interval confirmed that our assumptions on the model2 are correct.
Int,"An explanation for these results could be that the water vapor measured in the air represented water “already evaporated” from the surrounding vegetation, and thus its effect on preventing high temperatures and fire growth was partially negated."
Int,"Our study found that there is an association between the pollutants: ozone, particulate matter, and increased mortality."
Data,"Overall, we only have evidence to reasonably conclude $O_3$, $SO_2$, and 'temperature' may have a non-zero association with 'death'"
Res,"As shown in the graph, the regression equation is."
Data,"To determine severity, we will be using the variable “area,” which signifies the fires' total burned area in hectares."
Data,The mean income for people who answered “never” was the lowest.
RQDef,"The first research question explores whether the claim cost is associated with age, and characterizes the association if there is one."
Struct,Let's explore the relationship between the response and explanatory variables.
RQDef,"Therefore, our inital prediction is that the majority of data points for the area will be from 10 - 50 hectares, with a few right outliers."
Res,"However, when we looked at the relationship between age of account and number of views per video, we found no relationship."
MethDef,"Though our final model, which minimizes LOOCV error, uses a smooth spline with $df = 6$, its LOOCV error is not significantly lower than that of the simple linear model."
MethJust,"Looking at figure 2, we see that the relationships between the response variable (maximum.longevity.yrs) and the predictor variables (metabolic.by.mass and Temperature) appear non linear and very weak."
RQDef,Our initial hypothesis is that the category Music will be the most frequent one and then News & Politics will be the least frequent category.
RQDef,This report aims to promote a better understanding on forest fires as a whole and other factors associated with forest fires.
Lim,"Overall, it seems that the lagged GAM is not sufficient to explain the relationship between pollutant levels and mortality rate."
RQDef,Is the true mean playing time greater than 200 minutes?
MethJust,We use the lagged version of the temperature for consistency with our chosen model.
MethJust,"In EDA, we see that all key variables are either related to the response variable or the $Metabolic.log$."
Data,We can see from Figure 1 that the distribution of Maximum longevity is right skewed and unimodal (3) .
MethJust,This was also indicated in the univariate analysis of these two variables.
MethDef,"Let muB, muW, muO, muT, muE, muS, muL denote the true mean title lengths for Business, World, Other, Tech, Entertainment, Social Media, and Lifestyle respectively."
Lim,"Additionally, the data we are using is over 20 years old, thus the atmosphere will most likely have a different composition in real time."
Data,The mean subscriber count is 3201757.576 subscribers.
MethJust,"Second, the population must be at least 20 times as large as the sample."
Struct,Figure 1 shows the distribution of our 4 key variables using histograms.
Int,We see that a reduced metabolism may indeed be related to increased lifespans.
Struct,"Before conducting multivariate analysis, it's important to analyze our response variable, 'death', over time to determine if any historical events may have led to unexpected outliers."
MethDef,"For both Model 1 and 2, we will use smooth spline terms for all individual variables with 4 degrees of freedom ($df$)"
Struct,"Fifth, from Figure 4, we plotted the death rate over time (in blue) and computed its moving average over a time window of width 30 days (in black)"
Lim,"However, at the same time, it is worth noticing that the model is not very accurate, and numbers can be far off when we look at any individual cases."
RQDef,"Second, is the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan nonlinear, even after transformations."
Data,"It has almost no outliers, so its mean and median are very close, varying only by 1 degree."
MethDef,"To better understand the relationships between these means, we graphically investigate the relationship between drugs and age on a box plot."
MethJust,"We can justify the use of a t-test for the distribution of age because of random sampling (assumed to be a random sample of n=1500 from the population), large population (59946>n=1500*30), and the distribution having no outliers (even though the distribution is skewed, the use of a t-test is still valid because of the large sample size and no outliers)."
Int,There may be confounding variables that were not including in our dataset.
Struct,"Next, we will compare all relevant variables to our predictor variable, death, which will be visible in Figure 5"
Data,"Country is also a categorical variable, it documents the country from which the account is based and the videos are uploaded."
Data,Goalkeeper seems to have the most playtime while Midfielder and Forward seem to have the least amount of playtime.
MethJust,"Thus, the use of ANOVA is justified."
MethDef,"Let p(mD) denote the population probability of men drinking socially, and let p(fD) denote the population probability of women drinking socially."
Int,"Without bootstrapping, we are ignoring some assumptions, and this might indicate about the model that it is not as good as the bootstrapped one (7)"
Lim,"This prompts research into the possible presence of a hidden variable that could ""explain"" this correlation"
Context,There must be an algorithm to organize which discussion forums are listed first ranking in them by usefulness.
MethDef,"For each model, we will use degrees of freedom ($df$) = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, respectively, and we will refer to them as Model 2, Model 3, $cdots{}$, Model 6 (Model 2 has $df = 3$ and Model 6 has $df = 7$) (2)."
MethJust,"Therefore, we may safely say the model fits well with no particular assumption violated (4)."
Struct,Figure 4 shows the residual diagnostic plots for Model 2
Int,"From the regression table above, we can conclude that on average, the increase in the number of subscribers increases the number of views on a channel."
MethJust,"Overall, the variables all seem quite normally distributed with some skewedness and outliers, but I wouldn't see a transformation to be necessary (1)"
Struct,We must now examine the residual diagnostics of our lagged Poisson GAM to see whether the model assumptions hold.
RQDef,"Overall, this suggests that there is a relationship between playtime and a player’s position."
Data,It is important to note that there are very different group sizes.
Res,Our lagged model that we selected has a smaller prediction error than that of the model without lagged variables (3)
MethJust,"The transformations we made are particularly encouraging because from Figure 3, our response variable, 'Maximum.longevity.yrs.log', looks much more normally distributed from its density plot."
RQDef,"However, we suspect that defenders, midfielders, and forwards pass more with more time played."
Int,The fluctuating trend in the figure represents the changes in weather.
MethDef,"However, as shown in the EDA, we log transformed both of these variables."
MethJust,"R-squared is a somewhat flawed metric, but having a multiple R-squared of 0.342 indicates that this basic linear model is leaving a lot of variation in lifespan unexplained."
MethDef,The temperature modle is fitted using poisson GAM with 4 degrees of freedom uing only temperature.
MethJust,"Finally, the population standard deviations must be approximately equal."
RQDef,Preston Jorgenson also asked us to examine what the number of deaths would be with the lowest pollutant values on a 70-degree day to determine whether he should put extensive funding into reducing pollution levels.
Res,"(2) Regarding whether reducing the crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% would cause its lifespan to change, yes it will change, and theoretically it will increase the maximum lifespan from estimation of 14.4206 to 17.59354."
Data,"Similarly, the mean of 'Temperature' is 308.09 and its standard deviation is 5.36, which aligns with our expectation of leftward skew with a clear center."
MethJust,We often prefer simpler models as more flexible models will often over-fit the data and have poor out-of-sample performance.
Lim,Future research regarding this topic would need to use random sampling in order to eliminate bias and properly justify all the conditions required in order to use the Chi-Square Test.
RQDef,Our second analysis looks at the effects of smoking on how fit you are.
MethJust,The ANOVA test is valid because n >= 30 for all groups of drug use tested.
RQDef,"The second question of this report considers whether the month of the year is associated with fire severity and, if so, identifies their relationship."
MethDef,"To then test the relationship between subscribers and category graphically, we use a side-by-side boxplot diagram (figure 2 below)."
MethDef,"(1) To test the goodness of fit of model 2, I conduct the following hypothesis test: begin{center} Null Hypothesis: $H_0$: My chosen model (Model 2) is correct end{center} begin{center} Alternative Hypothesis: $H_a$: The saturated model is correct end{center}"
Res,"There are also two outliers for area, which are about 746ha and 1091ha."
Struct,"To answer Jorgesen's questions, we modeled multiple models to predict the death rate using our observations of air quality."
MethDef,"For consistency, we fit a GAM to predict $death$ from $lag_tmpd$ and $time$ using the log-link from the Poisson family, and we call it Model 3 (see $Appendix$ note 1)"
MethJust,"Because the cause of death is high levels of heat, and it is related to our variable of temperature, we do not see a need to remove these data observations."
Int,"With the assumption that almost all fires under the side of 0.1 hectares burned are too small to have been extinguished by firefighter teams called in for that specific job and can be considered unlikely to cause significant damage to the forest, we suggest that the vast majority of wildfires do not require human intervention."
Lim,"Otherwise, lag-PM10 shows an approximately positive association, however, we lack data near the right tail, and this is the range (above about PM10 = 20) where the positive association is visually most drastic."
Data,Its histogram indicates that the distribution is heavily right-skewed with the majority of the data lying between -5 and 5 grams per cubic meter.
MethJust,Females: (385)(0.365) = 140.53 ≥ 10 (385)(1- 0.365) = 244.48 ≥ 10.
Lim,"When it comes to our bootstrap, we could have run more iterations for accuracy even though 1000 was sufficient."
MethJust,"Pollutants pm10median, o3median, and so2median are necessary since we are answering the question if pollutants are correlated with mortality rate."
MethDef,We constructed a linear model using Metabolic Rate as the predictor since the initial plot seemed to be approximately linear.
Struct,"In order to use the Chi-Square Test, a number of formal assumptions must be met."
Data,It is noticeable that the $death.log$ is particularly high for some dates in July 1995 (3)
Data,"As seen on Table 2 above, the sample means of income for drug use are slightly different."
Res,We could clearly see in Figure 9 that there is an association between having a lower metabolic rate by mass and a higher mean lifespan for the animal species in the dataset (1) .
MethDef,We compute the regression values in the table below.
Res,"We use a Chi-Squared test to assess this, and as there is a p-value of 1.19 x $10^{-15}$ produced, we can say there is significant evidence that our model using the averages of the pollutants and temperature as predictors improves significantly on the model using only temperature to predict death rate."
RQDef,"Due to this, we hypothesize that women will drink less socially than men."
MethJust,"For the original GAM, we used the four continuous variables as our predictor variables and found that pm10median and tmpd were significant (p < 0.001) except for o3median and so2median (p>0.05)"
Res,"Using the pivotal confidence interval and 1000 bootstrap iterations, we get a confidence interval of [114.4780,114.9618], with mean 114.7240 (6)"
Res,"From Figure 5, it appears that $SO_2$ is associated with decreased death, while PM10 and $O_3$ are associated with increased morality."
Other,Note that only plotting against the fitted values is equivalent to plotting against the log of metabolic rate since our model only has one predictor.
Data,"The first variable is $time$, which measures the number of days before or after December 31, 1993"
Struct,This is a chart representation of the mean age of each category of drug taking frequency.
MethDef,"To begin, we construct a linear model to predict using the two variables: 'Maximum.longevity.yrs' and 'Metabolic.by.mass'."
Lim,"However, there are limitations to randomness of the data."
Res,"This translates to for every one unit increase in metabolic rate, there is a decrease in lifespan of 1.669777 years."
Int,This seems to imply that the association between temperature and the deaths is the strongest.
Int,"However our 95% confidence interval for this estimation is [17.45691, 21.54319], which doesnt indicate significance to this change in expected maximum lifespan, since 19 years is still within the interval."
MethDef,We are going to explore the key relationship through two models which are based on general additive model.
Res,"Performing a Chi-squared test on body_type and drinks gives us an x-squared value of 111.6, a df of 60, and a p-value of .0000596."

Data,"In this report, we will use a part of the $Anage$ dataset to answer our research question."
Res,"Looking at Figure 5, we can actually see that the medians for videos uploaded in India and in Great Britain are fairly similar to the median of the United States."
Data,"To be more specific, we would focus on three pollutants - ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter - to assess the air pollution level."
Struct,"Now that we have confirmed that the lagged model is a good fit for the data, we must look to answer the research questions we started with."
Context,Those hoping to find a career in it would find it most beneficial to discover which category is the most popular.
Data,We also see that the minimum shots attempted for all positions is 0.
Int,"Although the lifespan of a crab-eating raccoon with a standard metabolic rate is 19 years, we can not be certain that reducing its metabolic rate by 50% results in an increased lifespan until we derive a pivotal confidence interval."
Res,"Based on the data observed, we can conclude that August, July, and September, in increasing order, have the most severe risk for fire damage by area, while January, May, and November have the least."
Int,"Because these relationships between pollutants and mortality appear to be non-linear, particularly for $O_3$, we can't directly state that increasing a pollutant by a unit is proportionally associated with an increase in mortality."
Data,"As a measure of air pollution, $pm10$ measures the median density of $PM_{10}$ pollution in milligrams per cubic meter."
Data,"Using a portion of the AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity dataset, we will answer the questions being asked."
MethJust,"(6) As stated previously when we were examining the residual plots, we see that there are some inconsistent variance."
Lim,"The data set had more bias to the elderly, with a mean of 60 years old."
MethJust,"As we mentioned before, death does not follow a Poisson distribution."

Data,"The dataset we are using has 347 observations of 14 variables, which contains all entries from AnAge for animals in the Chordata phylum, which, roughly speaking, includes animals with spinal cords, with entries that has missing variables removed."
MethDef,"Since the conditions are mostly satisfied, we decide to proceed with the ANOVA test at the 0.05 significance level."
Lim,"Furthermore, in the future, we would like to extend the scope of our analysis and include more variables, such as the mobile devices used when subscribing to an account."
Struct,"Below is the scatterplot and associated regression line for the relationship between age and income, based on the user profiles in the data."
MethDef,"We will create five models on the same data and set the degrees of freedom (df) to be 3,4,...,7."
MethDef,"(2) To determine if pollutants have an association with our response, log-deaths, we run an chi square deviance test on a reduced null model, including no pollutant variables, and our chosen lag-model from the previous section."
Int,"Therefore, it is fair to say that there is no relationship between sex and education."
Res,"From an analysis of the first and third quartile and the interquartile range, it can be seen from table 2 that individual points grow further apart as the area increases."
Data,Income is a quantitative variable that measures a persons income in US $.

RQDef,"For this research, we are interested in the possible associations which may exist between one’s sex and substance-usage habits."
RQDef,"Circling back to one of the original research questions proposed, we will use our model to predict the number of deaths for a 70 degree day with the lowest observed levels of each (7 day average) pollutant."
RQDef,"Specifically, Jorgensen tasked us with finding evidence of whether pollutants are associated with increased deaths at all and, if so, identifying the pollutants that are most associated with increased deaths."
RQDef,Our last research question will investigate if there is a relationship between sex and relationship status.
Int,"The confidence interval of (19.24863,41.35943) years doesn't include the normal lifespan which is sufficent evidence to suggest an increase in lifespan."
Lim,The clustering of datapoints in the graphs including log transformed temperature dont form an noticable linear pattern between the variables.
RQDef,We hypothesize that the channels labeled with the frequent categories have more views than the channels labeled as the least frequent categories.
Res,"We can also see that each category, aside from news and & politics and sports, which each have two points outside of the interquartile range, has a significant number of outliers, and that many of the medians do not fall within the range we hypothesized."
MethDef,"It is hard to distinguish patterns with the outliers so although we have decided to keep them in the data set for the model, we will remove them for the plots in Figure 6 too see the pattern better (4)"
Context,"These patients often have serious illnesses and are at high risk of death if they do not receive a transplant (as detailed in the report by Mayo Clinic, https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/liver-transplant/about/pac-20384842)."
MethJust,"However, there seems to be a sufficiently linear, and have a very slightly negative slope."
Res,"We get a p-value of 0.0734, which is greater than 0.05, so we do not reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is not a relationship between diagnosis and PatientMDRB."
Res,"Using the data seen by our chosen lag-model, we find that the lowest observed value for lag-PM10 pollution is -24.12 (scaled mg/m^3), and our lowest observed value for lag-ozone pollution is -18.9239 (scaled ppb)"
MethDef,"Next, we will analyze the total passes of players by position graphically with side by side box plots, seen in the box plots below."
Data,"Lag_so2median has a minimum of -4.6433, maximum of 10.6562, median of -0.8747, mean of -0.649, and standard deviation of 1.557"
RQDef,Our third and final question is going to be characterizing the relationship between DMC and DC.
Int,"Furthermore, we can see that pollutants do indeed have an affect on mortality."
Lim,"Our analysis could also be improved with more data on the animals, as it is possible that there is a confounding variable influencing the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan (3)."
Int,We have sufficient evidence to expect that the true mean of attempted shots is less than 3.
Int,It is much smaller than 1 and this relatively small coefficient suggests a relatively weak correlation between the two variables.
Lim,This means that residuals are more widely distributed across smaller values of these two pollutants and are more narrowly distributed for larger values of these two pollutants.
MethJust,"Similarly, the standard errors of the models for the lower degrees of freedom are much higher those of the models with higher degrees of freedom."
Int,"Overall, we have evidence that the true mean of the user profiles’ age was greater than 30 year and that there is a relationship between drugs and age, but not that there was a relationship between age and income."
MethDef,"Note: All of the graphs in this section are zoomed in to show the relationships in the scatterplots better, since there are a large number of high outliers for the quantitative measures of success variables."
Data,Note that we can see there are many potential outliers in our response variable.
MethJust,QQ-plot in Figure 8 also does not indicate any particular assumption violation as there is no noticeable divergence in the plot.
Context,"Because so many people seek connection, a large amount of data can be collected from online dating profiles about the habits of a diverse population."
Context,"It’s common knowledge that smoking, drinking, and doing drugs isn’t good for your body."
Context,"One would think that the longer that one has an account on Youtube and the more videos one has uploaded, the more popular and the more views, subscribers, etc. one would have."
Struct,"Now, we want to look at our response variable, death."
MethJust,This means that our ANOVA test is justified despite the outliers and skewness in the box plot.
RQDef,"Using our selected model, we examined whether reducing the metabolic rate of Jorgensen's crab-eating raccoon would cause its lifespan to change."
Int,"With research, we found that this was the time of the 1995 Chicago Heat Wave, where residents died due to heat-related causes due to abnormally high temperature."
Struct,The following figure tabulates the varying levels of drug use.
Data,"Most users don’t use drugs with a proportion of 0.641, some users have no response with a proportion of 0.139, extreme users have a proportion of 0.013, and moderate users have a proportion of 0.207."
RQDef,And how do video genre preferences differ by country?
RQDef,"However, we want to know whether more subscribers leads to more views per video for that channel and whether there is a correlation between the subscriber count and views per video."
Lim,The only caveat lies in the condition of justifying the shape of the chi-square distribution in which each expected count as to be at least 5.
Res,"We found that this relationship is after using log transformations on lifespan and metabolic rate, their relationship is approximately linear."
Lim,"OkCupid provides only 4 objective options to how much a person uses drugs whereas for drinking habits, offers more subjective options like “socially” and “desperately”, as if those attributes could not be applied to marijuana use (they can)."
Int,"Further, it can be seen in the correlation table (table 4), we can see that the correlation is .135 which shows a very weak relationship between the amount of subscribers and viewsPerVideo."
MethJust,Notice that the 5-fold average prediction error is much lower for the lagged GAM than that of the original GAM
Struct,This is a bar chart showing the income of OkCupid users and the frequency of each bracket in the dataset.
RQDef,"Since there are 4 different main positions within soccer, we are interested in the distribution among the different positions."
Lim,"Also, the errors I get from my potential models (linear model and spline models) have small differences compared to their standard deviations."
Lim,There could be other factors that contribute to change of lifespan and therefore we may not assume that the only variable that changes lifespan is Metabolic Rate by Mass (3).
Res,"Given the cross-validation results from our Modeling and Diagonistics section, we found that using the lagged covariates as our predictor variables gave lower predictor error and standard error."
Lim,To improve our model to address this minor error of heteroskedasticity we could have used a robust smoothing spline which includes robust standard errors within our smoothing spline model.
Int,"From this information, we are unable to pinpoint the exact relationship between smoking and body type, but we can say that one exists."
Other,If the points deviate from the straight line this is an indication of an issue with normality in our model.
Lim,"On top of that, more people should be sampled in order to gather more individuals who answer “often” for drug usage."
RQDef,"Of the several contributing factors to pollution, we will be examining air pollution, as all humans regardless of location need clean air to breathe."
Int,"In the context of the data, there is not a significant relationship between drinking and drug use among OkCupid users."
MethDef,"H0: Drug use and status are independent, and are not associated."
Res,"Third, if each pollutant were lowered to be the lowest value ever, my model will predict the mean death number for Chicago on a 70-degree day to be between 106.3425 and 114.5066"
Data,"Each measurement countains a 'time', time it was taken, 'death', the number of non-accidental deaths on that day, 'pm10median', the median density of PM-10 pollution, 'o3median', the median concentration of ozone, 'so2median', the median concentration of sulfur dioxide, adn the temperatures."
Data,The metabolic by mass variable has a spread .00004543 watts/grams to .04143 watts/grams and a center around .003023.
Res,"As pollutants in the air increase, so do the deaths."
Res,"(2) Applying the model to the crab-eating raccoon, we estimate that with a 50% decrease in metabolic rate its lifespan would be 28.42159 years."
RQDef,We will be examining how the factor of sex interacts with other variables in the study.
Data,The analysis focused on the number of shots attempted for a sample of 595 soccer players that played in the 2010 World Cup.
Data,"In the histogram below, we see that most players don’t have a lot of playtime in the World Cup, with most the time being below 200 minutes."
Res,"From our analysis of the database, we are able to find that there is a generally negative non linear relationship between maximum lifespan and metabolic rate."
RQJust,"For example, corporate careers have more opportunities for growth than a high school teaching career."
MethJust,"If more data was available and the data indicated that there's less curvature on these ends in reality, our current model isn't guaranteed to be ""correct"", which would break the assumption for the parametric bootstrap"
Data,PM10 also showed a positive non-linear relationship with temperature with much less degree(4)
RQDef,The third question is to analyze whether there is an association between drug use and age.
Data,Height is a quantitative variable that characterizes users’ heights in inches.
MethDef,"However, in order to accurately test our hypotheses, we will perform a formal hypothesis test for a difference in proportions."
Lim,"Other factors which impact the potential range of this study revolve around the limited biodiversity (a single park) of the studied sample, as the data for forest fires may be impacted by the plant life and terrain it occurs in, and the time frame."
Res,We find this change significant as well (2).
Struct,Table 1 below displays our results (2)
MethDef,The saturated model has 4012 degrees of freedom and my model has 17 degrees of freedom.
Res,"It can also be seen that countries like the Republic of Korea, Australia, and the United Arab Emirates have higher interquartile ranges due to their medians being higher than most other countries."
Data,"We note that there are several y-axis outliers, where several users report income of $1,000,000, about 2 users that report an income of $500,000, and several report an income of a little more that $200,000."
Struct,"Before we build our models, we must explore the shape and distribution of each variable indivdualy."
Res,"We observe that most fires are very small, and it is only a few outlier fires that grow large enough to become a threat to larger amounts of forest land."
MethDef,"Where the mus indicate the true means of age in years for the four categories of drug usage frequency: never, sometimes, often, and null."
RQDef,Our aim is to understand the impact of pollutants in the air on mortality.
Other,We can analyze this data to answer the three questions we defined in the introduction.
Context,"In fact, we can also see many news and media companies turn to social media."
Data,"Firstly, we see in figure 4 that log-death still does not seem to be directly related to any particular measurement of pollution, but maintains its negative association with temperature."
Data,"The same holds true for the 7-day average of PM10 pollution, lag_pm10median, and lag_O3median."
MethJust,"Looking at Figure 4, we find that our log transformation has helped change our data to be more linear."
Data,"Our response variable, Maximum Longevity, appears to be unimodal with a right skew."
Lim,"For example, the “recommended video” feature and the YouTube algorithm in itself would greatly influence view count."
MethDef,"(5) Therefore, we need to check the model assumptions by plotting diagnostic plots for our best model to check the validity of our model."
MethDef,"Since the relationship looks linear, (1) we want to first try to use a linear model, predicting 'Maximum.longevity.yrs' using 'Metabolic.by.mass' and 'Log.body.mass.g'."
RQDef,"Although we have not confirmed there to be a relationship between sex and drinking habits, we are interested in exploring a different possible relationship: sex and smoking habits."
MethJust,Also the data was gathered using randomization and the standard deviations are within a factor of 2.
Lim,"Thus, it seems reasonable to say that the conclusions gained from this data might not apply to the population of people seeking romantic connection in general."
Struct,"Now that we have analyzed the variable, we can now state our hypothesis."
RQDef,We hypothesize that there will be a relationship between sex and education.
Int,(1) Preston Jorgensen can conclude that reducing the crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% would cause its lifespan to change in increase by 1.77764.
MethJust,"We decided to use the model with the lagged variables partly because of the slightly smaller average prediction error from cross-validation, but also due to the researcher's belief that the lagged pollutant and temperature variables contain more information and are more stable than the non-lagged variables and it would make sense that the effect of pollution would extend over time rather than be instantaneous."
Context,The subject of drinking can be an important factor in deciding on your romantic partner.
Data,"The smallest, or youngest mean, is for the often category, with a mean of 26.900."
Res,"We can see that the 7-day average of temperature does seem to be the most associated with death rate, but of the 3 pollutants, the 7-day average of the median density of $PM_{10}$ pollution appears to be the next highest associated variable with death rate."
RQDef,"(1) Firstly, we would search whether there is evidence that these pollutants are associated with increased mortality and which exhibits the strongest association."
MethDef,"Similarly, for the lagged, Model 2, we use the same type of model but with covariates 'lag_pm10median', 'lag_o3median', 'lag_so2median', and 'lag_tmpd'"
MethDef,"From our residual diagnostic plots, it seems that bootstrapping by resampling cases is the most appropriate choice for our data."
Int,"It is lower than the actual mortality on 30 December 2000, which is 145 people."
Res,"In conclusion, (1) after the analysis we found out that generally there is an inverse relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan."
RQJust,"From above, it seems that the level of pollution might depend on temperature due to changes in air movement."
Struct,Below is output a summary of the straightforward linear model.
Data,"Each observation includes variables such as death number, median density of PM$_{10}$ pollution, median concentration of ozone, median concentration of SO$_{2}$, and mean temperature."
Res,"Since the p-value of 0 is below the alpha value of 0.01, we reject the null hypothesis."
Int,"Meanwhile, 'predict' assumes the model is correct since it invokes methods that depends on the 'class' of the object we input, a GAM"
Struct,"Before we conduct a two-sample proportion test, we again want to compare our variables visually."
MethDef,The alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant improvement in the model upon adding the average of the pollutants as predictors.
MethJust,We also found from the Explanatory Data Analysis section that all four explanatory variables shared an overall normal distribution so we found that transformations were unnecessary.
Res,We can see a relationship between the number of subscribers and the views.
Data,We also note the presence of multiple NAs in $PM_{10}$ and all of our lagged variables.
RQDef,"Simultaneously, we would hypothesize that categories with fewer subscribers would be harder to gain a following because they would not show much interest."
Other,The difference between the mean and the median suggests that the graph should be skewed to the right since the median is much smaller than the mean.
Int,"In other words, there's significant evidence to conclude pollutants are associated with mortality."
Data,Note that later on in our exploratory data analysis we decide to exclude a series of outliers from our data (1995 Chicago Heat Wave) resulting in a new total of 4007 observations for the remainder of the paper.
Lim,"However, given the complexity of our data, a more complex model may fit the data better and be able to give more accurate inference and prediction."
Int,"$PM_{10}$ appears to have the next strongest association with mortality due to more data points existing at the upper end of its plot to ""explain"" the curvature compared to $SO_2$"
MethDef,"Moreover, we used non-parametric bootstrapping to assess the 95% confidence interval for the mean number of deaths, given the circumstances described above."
Data,Account country is also a categorical variable and indicates the country where a given youtube account is located.
RQDef,"In order to get a clearer picture of everything, we must also look at whether or not there is a relationship between the date of publication and title length."
Res,"Consequently, A 95% pivotal CI for $death$ in a setting described above is [102.7891, 112.2995] (6)"
MethJust,"We see that the residuals seem to be patternless and have the same spread, which suggests that linearity and homoscedasticity hold."
Res,"However, it appears that a decrease in the level of $SO_2$ and extremely low levels of ozone are associated with an increase in mortality, which is worth further research."
Res,"Although we see some slight differences in the means and medians for subscribers given by category, the variation displayed is sufficiently large and the different boxplots sufficiently similar that we do not have sufficient evidence to back up our hypothesis and state that there is a relationship between the number of subscribers and the channel’s category."
Context,This can help creators understand how many views they can expect to garner based on their subscriber count and whether they can gain a high number of views despite their subscriber count.
MethDef,"By transforming metabolic rate and average lifespan, though, we were able to see a linear relationship between them."
Data,"While there are some large outliers, they're not significant enough to create a skew."
Res,"We additionally observed that the most popular channel to exist on the platform is entertainment, despite comedy channels having the most subscribers overall."
RQDef,Which pollutant seems to be most strongly associated with mortality.
MethDef,"To determine if these differences between the models are significant, we recorded prediction and standard errors from running 5-fold cross validation multiple times (not shown in paper)"
Lim,This leads me to conclude that log transforming the temperature variable did not lead to much improvement as the histogram in Figure 3 is still left skewed and the scatterplot in the pairs plot do not have any distinguishable linear patterns or trends.
Res,"As the ozone cocentration increases, so does mortality."
MethDef,"Therefore, the following histogram and boxplot of death will be log-transformed."
Lim,This analysis was limited as viewsPerVideo can be thrown off by outliers such as trending videos which are videos that are more popular than the rest of a creators videos.
MethDef,"To test the research question, we can perform a Pearson’s Chi-squared test."
Res,"Comparatively, a crab-eating raccoon without the reduced metabolic rate would expect to have a lifespan of about 19 years."
MethDef,Our null and alternative hypotheses are.
Struct,"Next, we need to construct our formal hypothesis."
Data,"Other relationships that have become more clear are ozone and PM10 as well as sulfur dioxide and PM10, which both show a positive association."
RQJust,"So when the plaintiff demands a specific amount and is successful, it is highly possible that the judge decides the amount of total damages based on that demand."
MethJust,"Due to such benefits through log-transformation, we will be using them for the rest of the analysis (4)."
MethJust,"As you can see from Figure 1, the standard deviations are relatively similar."
MethDef,We compared model2 with the model that only uses temperature using hypothesis test.
MethJust,"When examining Figure 3 and the other variable distribution plots from our univariate data exploration, we see that there is significant skew across many of the variables."
RQDef,Our second research question is whether severity of the liver disease that caused the need for a transplant is related to whether the patient contracts an MDRB infection.
Context,"Soccer, otherwise known as football, is a well-known sport that is played all around the world with playability ranging from kicking a ball around to being the main focus of international competitions."
Data,"As seen in table 2, the ISI values for this dataset range from 0 to about 56."
Struct,"The left column shows the distribution of our variables measured on any particular day, while the right column shows the distribution of our variables measured as 7-day averages, wherein the observation represents the average measurements of the prior week."
Res,The figure shows on mode around 1 million to 1.5 million subscribers.
Context,"However, given the sudden boom in biological research, it now suddenly seems possible that the key to immortality is not a magical ruin or long-lost relic, but it is instead within your own body at this very minute."
RQJust,"Between our response variable, 'log_death' and each of the lag variables, the correlation coefficients have increased."
MethJust,"Although Model 5 has the least LOOCV error among the 6 models, its performance is not significantly better than the rest 5 models (5)."
Int,"Among the pollutants, 'lag_o3median' is most associated with mortality, because it has the tightest band of uncertainty compared to the rest two pollutants."
MethDef,But a nonparametric model such as the smoothing spline is more approriate.
MethDef,I also perform residual diagnostics.
Data,The most common position within the sample is Midfielder while the least common position is Goalkeeper.
Data,"The primary focus will be the variable claim costs, a quantitative variable measuring the total cost of claims made by subscribers in dollars."
Res,"Further examination of the results displays Sports as the least frequent category, with less than 50 channels (count of 23) and News & Politics coming in as second last with less than 50 channels (count of 46)."
Lim,"This again may point to the fact that we have the two clusters of points as previously mentioned in our EDA, but still provides the relevant evidence to Preston's claim."
Data,"These variables include drinks, body type, and income."
Res,This confidence interval yielded a range of 18.57 to 22.98 years for the mean lifespan of a crab-eating raccoon with a 50% slower metabolic rate.
Int,"However, it is important to remember that this is an observational study."
Other,"First, we have to make sure there is a significantly large sample size for each group."
MethDef,"Due to varying body sizes, we divided the metabolic rate value (measured in Watts) provided in the dataset by the body mass (measured in grams) so that we are able to properly compare metabolic rates across all species."
Struct,3 The diagnostic plots of Model 1.2 are on the next page.
Res,But Figures 4 and 5 also show that videos posted in India and Great-Britain on average do as well as videos from the United States.
MethDef,"In Figure 1, we used a scatterplot to compare the cost of total claims with the age of the subscriber."
