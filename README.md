## Stats Moves Model Training

See the data folder for the training data. Note that data from Cornell still needs to be aligned with the data from CMU.

Model training can be done with [SBERT](https://www.sbert.net/) alone or with [Cross-Encoders](https://www.sbert.net/examples/training/cross-encoder/README.html).

You can find discussions of sentence classification here:

For cross-encoder training, one commenter use this to adjust from training pairs of sentences to a single sentence with a label:

```
train_samples = []
for sent, label in zip(X_train, y_train):
    label_id = label2int[label]
    train_samples.append(InputExample(texts=[sent], label=label_id))

train_dataloader = DataLoader(train_samples, shuffle=True, batch_size=train_batch_size)

dev_samples = []
for sent, label in zip(X_dev, y_dev):
    label_id = label2int[label]
    dev_samples.append(InputExample(texts=[sent], label=label_id))

```
